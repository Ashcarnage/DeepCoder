### üìä **Concrete Before vs After Examples**

#### **Memory Debugging Scenario:**

**BEFORE:** *(Empty response)*

**AFTER:**
```
I'll debug this memory leak systematically using available tools.

TOOL_CALL: system_monitor
Parameters: monitor memory usage and identify growth patterns
Reasoning: Need baseline memory metrics

TOOL_OUTPUT: 
Memory: 8.2GB/16GB (51%), Python process: 7.8GB RSS
Growth rate: +50MB/min (linear increase)
Top consumers: dict objects (2.1GB), cached data (1.8GB)

ANALYSIS: Clear memory leak with linear growth. Main issues are unbounded dictionaries and cached data not being garbage collected.

TOOL_CALL: code_analyzer  
Parameters: scan for memory leak patterns and GC issues
Reasoning: Identify specific leak sources in code

TOOL_OUTPUT:
Memory leak sources found:
- Line 45: Large dictionaries in loop never cleared
- Line 120: Circular references preventing GC
- Line 203: File handles not properly closed
- Cache grows without size limits

ANALYSIS: Multiple leak sources identified. Need to implement proper cleanup, break circular references, and add cache size limits.

TOOL_CALL: terminal_command
Parameters: run memory profiler for detailed analysis
Reasoning: Confirm patterns and measure impact

TOOL_OUTPUT:
Allocation rate: 150MB/min, Deallocation: 100MB/min
Net leak: +50MB/min, GC cycles: 1,234 (many objects uncollectable)
Largest allocations: dict_resize operations (45% of memory)

ANALYSIS: Confirmed memory leak. Solution: 1) Break circular refs, 2) Implement cache limits, 3) Add resource cleanup, 4) Force GC intervals.
