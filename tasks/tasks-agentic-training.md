### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `pytest` for running tests: `pytest data/collection/` to test specific modules
- Data collection should respect rate limits and terms of service for all sources
- Focus on high-quality agentic interactions with clear tool use patterns
- Training pipeline should handle variable-length tool interaction sequences
