The array is sorted in ascending order, so that should help me use an efficient algorithm. The problem requires me to write a function that returns the index of the target if it exists, otherwise returns -1. And the solution must have O(log n) runtime complexity, which suggests that a binary search approach would be appropriate.\n\nLet me think about binary search. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It starts with the entire array, and in each step, it compares the target with the middle element. If the target is less than the middle, it narrows the search to the left half; if it's more, it narrows to the right half. This process continues until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, low and high. Low starts at 0 (the first index), and high starts at the last index of the array.\n2. While low is less than or equal to high, calculate the mid index, which is the average of low and high, but I should be careful with integer division to avoid overflow. In Python, using (low + high) // 2 should work.\n3. Compare the target with the element at the mid index.\n   a. If they are equal, return mid as the index.\n   b. If the target is less than the element at mid, set high to mid - 1 to search the left half.\n   c. If the target is greater, set low to mid + 1 to search the right half.\n4. If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1.\n\nWait, but what about duplicates? The problem doesn't specify if the array has duplicates, but since it's sorted, binary search should still work regardless. However, if there are multiple occurrences of the target, this implementation will return the first occurrence it finds, which is correct because the problem just asks for any index where the target exists.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nExample 1: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9.\n\nThe array has length 6. Let's see how the binary search proceeds.\n\n- low = 0, high = 5. mid = (0+5)//2 = 2. nums[2] is 3, which is less than 9. So set low = 3.\n- Now, low=3, high=5. mid = (3+5)//2 =4. nums[4] is 9, which is the target. So return 4. Correct.\n\nExample 2: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2.\n\n- low=0, high=5. mid=2, nums[2]=3 > 2. So set high=1.\n- Now, low=0, high=1. mid=0. nums[0] is -1 < 2. Set low=1.\n- Now, low=1, high=1. mid=1. nums[1]=0 <2. Set low=2.\n- Now low=2 > high=1. Loop ends. Return -1. Correct.\n\nSo the logic seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, I need to write this in Python. Let me outline the code.\n\nInitialize low and high:\n\nlow = 0\nhigh = len(nums) - 1\n\nThen, while loop:\n\nwhile low <= high:\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    if nums[mid] == target:\n        return mid\n    elif nums[mid] < target:\n        low = mid + 1\n    else:\n        high = mid - 1\n\nIf the loop exits without returning, return -1.\n\nWait, but what if the array is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, I suppose the function is given a valid array, but in code, if the array is empty, len(nums) would be 0, so high would be -1, and the loop wouldn't run, correctly returning -1.\n\nAnother edge case: target is the first element. For example, nums = [5], target=5. Then mid is 0, and it returns 0. If target is not present, like target=6, then high becomes -1, and returns -1.\n\nWhat about when the target is in the middle but the array is large? The binary search should handle that efficiently.\n\nI think this implementation should work correctly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the function would be:\n\ndef search(nums, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(nums) - 1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if nums[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif nums[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return -1\n\nI should test this code with the examples.\n\nTesting Example 1:\n\nnums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target=9.\n\nThe function should return 4.\n\nTesting Example 2:\n\nnums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target=2. Should return -1.\n\nI can also test with a single element.\n\nnums = [5], target=5 \u2192 returns 0.\n\nnums = [5], target=3 \u2192 returns -1.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [1,3,5,7,9], target=5 \u2192 returns 2.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nI think this should handle all cases correctly. So the final code is as written above.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to efficiently search for a target value in a sorted array of integers. Given the constraint that the solution must have a time complexity of O(log n), a binary search algorithm is the most appropriate approach.\n\n### Approach\nThe binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `low` set to the first index (0) and `high` set to the last index of the array.\n2. **Loop Until Pointers Meet**: Continue the search while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.\n3. **Calculate Midpoint**: In each iteration, compute the middle index `mid` using the average of `low` and `high`.\n4. **Compare Target with Middle Element**:\n   - If the target is found at the middle index, return `mid`.\n   - If the target is less than the middle element, adjust the `high` pointer to narrow the search to the left half.\n   - If the target is greater, adjust the `low` pointer to search the right half.\n5. **Return Result**: If the loop exits without finding the target, return -1.\n\nThis approach ensures that each step effectively halves the search space, leading to the desired O(log n) time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef search(nums, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(nums) - 1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if nums[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif nums[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The pointers `low` and `high` are initialized to cover the entire array.\n- **Midpoint Calculation**: The midpoint `mid` is calculated to determine the middle element of the current search interval.\n- **Comparison and Adjustment**: By comparing the target with the middle element, the search space is dynamically adjusted to either the left or right half, ensuring efficient narrowing down of potential locations for the target.\n- **Termination**: The loop terminates when the target is found or the search space is exhausted, ensuring the solution is both efficient and correct.\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases, including when the target is at the boundaries or not present in the array, making it a robust solution for the given problem.", "metadata": null, "timestamp": null}], "final_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to search for a target in a sorted array of integers.

Correct.\n\nExample 2: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2.\n\n- low=0, high=5. mid=2, nums[2]=3 > 2. So set high=1.\n- Now, low=0, high=1. mid=0. nums[0] is -1 < 2. Set low=1.\n- Now, low=1, high=1. mid=1. nums[1]=0 <2. Set low=2.\n- Now low=2 > high=1. Loop ends. Return -1. Correct.\n\nSo the logic seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, I need to write this in Python.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the problem is about substrings, which are contiguous sequences of characters. I remember that this is a classic sliding window problem. The sliding window technique is often used for problems where we need to find subarrays or substrings that satisfy certain conditions.\n\nLet me recall how the sliding window works. Usually, we have two pointers, a left and a right. The right pointer expands the window by moving forward, and the left pointer contracts it when a condition is met. In this case, the condition is that all characters in the window must be unique.\n\nHmm, so I need a way to keep track of the characters in the current window. A hash map or a set could be useful here. Maybe I can use a set to store the characters in the current window. When I add a new character, I check if it's already in the set. If it is, I need to move the left pointer forward until the duplicate is removed.\n\nWait, but using a set might not be the most efficient way because checking and removing can take time. Oh right, I remember that using a dictionary to store the last index of each character can be more efficient. That way, when a character is encountered again, we can quickly determine where the left pointer should move to.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, left and right, both starting at 0.\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the last seen index of each character.\n3. Iterate through the string with the right pointer.\n4. For each character at right, if it's already in the dictionary and its last index is >= left, then move the left pointer to one position after the last occurrence of this character.\n5. Update the dictionary with the current index of the character.\n6. Keep track of the maximum window size encountered.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the case where the same character appears multiple times? For example, in \"abba\", when right is at the second 'a', the left pointer should move to the position after the first 'a', which is index 3.\n\nLet me think through an example. Take s = \"abba\".\n\n- right = 0, char 'a': not in dict, add to dict. max_length = 1.\n- right = 1, char 'b': not in dict, add. max_length = 2.\n- right = 2, char 'b': already in dict at index 1. Since 1 >= left (0), move left to 2. Then add current index 2 to dict. Now, the window is from 2 to 2, length 1. Max remains 2.\n- right = 3, char 'a': in dict at 0. Since 0 < left (2), so it's outside the current window. So we can include it. Update dict to 3. Now the window is from 2 to 3, length 2. Max is still 2.\n\nWait, but the correct answer for \"abba\" is 2, which is \"ab\" or \"bb\" or \"ba\"? Wait no, the longest substring without repeating is \"ab\" (length 2) or \"bb\" (length 1) or \"ba\" (length 2). So the maximum is 2. So the approach works.\n\nAnother example: \"pwwkew\". Let's see:\n\n- right=0: 'p' not in dict, add. max=1.\n- right=1: 'w' not in dict, add. max=2.\n- right=2: 'w' is in dict at 1. So left moves to 2. Update 'w' to 2. max remains 2.\n- right=3: 'k' not in dict, add. window is 2-3, length 2. max still 2.\n- right=4: 'e' not in dict, add. window is 2-4, length 3. max is now 3.\n- right=5: 'w' is in dict at 2. Since 2 >= left (2), move left to 3. Update 'w' to 5. window is 3-5, length 3. max remains 3.\n\nSo the correct answer is 3, which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- A dictionary, let's call it last_seen, which maps characters to their last index.\n- Initialize left=0, max_length=0.\n- Iterate right from 0 to len(s)-1:\n   - If s[right] is in last_seen and last_seen[s[right]] >= left:\n       - Update left to last_seen[s[right]] + 1\n   - Update last_seen[s[right]] to right\n   - current_length = right - left + 1\n   - if current_length > max_length, update max_length\n\nWait, but in the initial steps, max_length is 0. So for the first character, current_length is 1, which is greater than 0, so max_length becomes 1.\n\nLet me test this logic with example 1: \"abcabcbb\"\n\nInitialize left=0, max_length=0, last_seen={}.\n\nright=0: 'a' not in last_seen. last_seen['a']=0. current_length=1. max=1.\n\nright=1: 'b' not in last_seen. last_seen['b']=1. current_length=2. max=2.\n\nright=2: 'c' not in last_seen. last_seen['c']=2. current_length=3. max=3.\n\nright=3: 'a' is in last_seen, at 0. 0 >= left (0), so left becomes 1. Update last_seen['a']=3. current_length=3. max remains 3.\n\nright=4: 'b' is in last_seen at 1. 1 >= left (1). So left becomes 2. Update last_seen['b']=4. current_length=3. max remains 3.\n\nright=5: 'c' is in last_seen at 2. 2 >= left (2). So left becomes 3. Update last_seen['c']=5. current_length=3. max remains 3.\n\nright=6: 'b' is in last_seen at 4. 4 >= left (3). So left becomes 5. Update last_seen['b']=6. current_length=2. max remains 3.\n\nright=7: 'b' is in last_seen at 6. 6 >= left (5). So left becomes 7. Update last_seen['b']=7. current_length=1. max remains 3.\n\nSo the final max_length is 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: \"bbbbb\".\n\nInitialize left=0, max=0.\n\nright=0: 'b' not in last_seen. Add 0. current_length=1. max=1.\n\nright=1: 'b' is in last_seen at 0 >=0. So left becomes 1. Update last_seen['b']=1. current_length=1. max remains 1.\n\nright=2: 'b' is in last_seen at 1 >=1. left becomes 2. Update to 2. current_length=1.\n\nAnd so on. So the max remains 1, which is correct.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nInitialize last_seen as empty dict.\n\nleft = 0\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor right in range(len(s)):\n\n    char = s[right]\n\n    if char in last_seen and last_seen[char] >= left:\n\n        left = last_seen[char] + 1\n\n    last_seen[char] = right\n\n    current_length = right - left + 1\n\n    if current_length > max_length:\n\n        max_length = current_length\n\nreturn max_length\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, I can write the Python function.\n\nWait, but what if the string is empty? The function should return 0. The code handles that because the loop won't run and max_length remains 0.\n\nTesting with the examples:\n\nExample 1: \"abcabcbb\" \u2192 3.\n\nExample 2: \"bbbbb\" \u21921.\n\nExample 3: \"pwwkew\" \u21923.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work. Now, I'll write the code and test it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string. This problem can be efficiently solved using the sliding window technique combined with a dictionary to keep track of the last seen positions of characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of the substring. The `right` pointer expands the window by moving forward, while the `left` pointer contracts the window when a repeating character is found.\n2. **Dictionary for Last Seen Index**: A dictionary is used to store the last index at which each character was seen. This helps in quickly determining if a character is repeating within the current window and adjusting the `left` pointer accordingly.\n3. **Iterate Through the String**: For each character at the `right` pointer, check if it has been seen before and if its last occurrence is within the current window. If so, move the `left` pointer to the right of the last occurrence. Update the dictionary with the current index of the character and calculate the current window length.

Take s = \"abba\".\n\n- right = 0, char 'a': not in dict, add to dict. max_length = 1.\n- right = 1, char 'b': not in dict, add. max_length = 2.\n- right = 2, char 'b': already in dict at index 1. Since 1 >= left (0), move left to 2. Then add current index 2 to dict. Now, the window is from 2 to 2, length 1. Max remains 2.\n- right = 3, char 'a': in dict at 0. Since 0 < left (2), so it's outside the current window. So we can include it. Update dict to 3. Now the window is from 2 to 3, length 2. Max is still 2.\n\nWait, but the correct answer for \"abba\" is 2, which is \"ab\" or \"bb\" or \"ba\"? Wait no, the longest substring without repeating is \"ab\" (length 2) or \"bb\" (length 1) or \"ba\" (length 2). So the maximum is 2. So the approach works.\n\nAnother example: \"pwwkew\". Let's see:\n\n- right=0: 'p' not in dict, add. max=1.\n- right=1: 'w' not in dict, add. max=2.\n- right=2: 'w' is in dict at 1. So left moves to 2. Update 'w' to 2. max remains 2.\n- right=3: 'k' not in dict, add. window is 2-3, length 2. max still 2.\n- right=4: 'e' not in dict, add. window is 2-4, length 3. max is now 3.\n- right=5: 'w' is in dict at 2. Since 2 >= left (2), move left to 3. Update 'w' to 5. window is 3-5, length 3. max remains 3.\n\nSo the correct answer is 3, which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- A dictionary, let's call it last_seen, which maps characters to their last index.\n- Initialize left=0, max_length=0.\n- Iterate right from 0 to len(s)-1:\n   - If s[right] is in last_seen and last_seen[s[right]] >= left:\n       - Update left to last_seen[s[right]] + 1\n   - Update last_seen[s[right]] to right\n   - current_length = right - left + 1\n   - if current_length > max_length, update max_length\n\nWait, but in the initial steps, max_length is 0. So for the first character, current_length is 1, which is greater than 0, so max_length becomes 1.\n\nLet me test this logic with example 1: \"abcabcbb\"\n\nInitialize left=0, max_length=0, last_seen={}.\n\nright=0: 'a' not in last_seen. last_seen['a']=0. current_length=1. max=1.\n\nright=1: 'b' not in last_seen. last_seen['b']=1. current_length=2. max=2.\n\nright=2: 'c' not in last_seen. last_seen['c']=2. current_length=3. max=3.\n\nright=3: 'a' is in last_seen, at 0. 0 >= left (0), so left becomes 1. Update last_seen['a']=3. current_length=3. max remains 3.\n\nright=4: 'b' is in last_seen at 1. 1 >= left (1). So left becomes 2. Update last_seen['b']=4. current_length=3. max remains 3.\n\nright=5: 'c' is in last_seen at 2. 2 >= left (2). So left becomes 3. Update last_seen['c']=5. current_length=3. max remains 3.\n\nright=6: 'b' is in last_seen at 4. 4 >= left (3). So left becomes 5. Update last_seen['b']=6. current_length=2. max remains 3.\n\nright=7: 'b' is in last_seen at 6. 6 >= left (5). So left becomes 7. Update last_seen['b']=7. current_length=1. max remains 3.\n\nSo the final max_length is 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: \"bbbbb\".\n\nInitialize left=0, max=0.\n\nright=0: 'b' not in last_seen. Add 0. current_length=1. max=1.\n\nright=1: 'b' is in last_seen at 0 >=0. So left becomes 1. Update last_seen['b']=1. current_length=1. max remains 1.\n\nright=2: 'b' is in last_seen at 1 >=1. left becomes 2. Update to 2. current_length=1.\n\nAnd so on. So the max remains 1, which is correct.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nInitialize last_seen as empty dict.\n\nleft = 0\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor right in range(len(s)):\n\n    char = s[right]\n\n    if char in last_seen and last_seen[char] >= left:\n\n        left = last_seen[char] + 1\n\n    last_seen[char] = right\n\n    current_length = right - left + 1\n\n    if current_length > max_length:\n\n        max_length = current_length\n\nreturn max_length\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, I can write the Python function.\n\nWait, but what if the string is empty? The function should return 0. The code handles that because the loop won't run and max_length remains 0.\n\nTesting with the examples:\n\nExample 1: \"abcabcbb\" \u2192 3.\n\nExample 2: \"bbbbb\" \u21921.\n\nExample 3: \"pwwkew\" \u21923.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work. Now, I'll write the code and test it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string. This problem can be efficiently solved using the sliding window technique combined with a dictionary to keep track of the last seen positions of characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of the substring. The `right` pointer expands the window by moving forward, while the `left` pointer contracts the window when a repeating character is found.\n2. **Dictionary for Last Seen Index**: A dictionary is used to store the last index at which each character was seen. This helps in quickly determining if a character is repeating within the current window and adjusting the `left` pointer accordingly.\n3. **Iterate Through the String**: For each character at the `right` pointer, check if it has been seen before and if its last occurrence is within the current window. If so, move the `left` pointer to the right of the last occurrence. Update the dictionary with the current index of the character and calculate the current window length.

For each element, I decide whether to add it to the current subarray or start a new subarray from there. Oh right, I also need to keep track of the maximum sum found so far.\n\nWait, let me break it down. I'll initialize two variables: one for the current maximum (current_max) and one for the global maximum (max_sum). Both start as the first element of the array. Then, for each subsequent element, I add it to current_max. If current_max becomes negative, I reset it to zero because a negative sum wouldn't help in maximizing the sum. But wait, no, I think that's for when all numbers are negative. Or maybe I should compare current_max with the current element itself. Oh right, in some versions of Kadane's algorithm, you take the maximum between the current element and current_max plus the element. That way, if adding the current element makes the sum worse, you just take the element as the new current_max.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. For each element, current_max is the maximum of (current_max + nums[i], nums[i]). But if all numbers are negative, this approach might not work because adding a negative number would make current_max worse. So maybe I should handle that case separately.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the subarray must contain at least one number, so if all are negative, the maximum is the least negative one. So I need to make sure that the algorithm doesn't just return zero in that case.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize max_current and max_global to the first element of the array.\n2. Loop through the array starting from the second element.\n3. For each element, set max_current to the maximum of (max_current + nums[i], nums[i]).\n4.

So max_so_far becomes max(-2, 1) = 1.\n\nNext element is -3:\nmax_ending_here = max(-3, 1 + (-3)) = max(-3, -2) = -2. max_so_far remains 1.\n\nNext element is 4:\nmax_ending_here = max(4, -2 +4) = max(4,2) =4. max_so_far is now 4.\n\nNext element is -1:\nmax_ending_here = max(-1,4-1=3) \u2192 3. max_so_far is still 4.\n\nNext element is 2:\nmax_ending_here = max(2,3+2=5) \u21925. max_so_far becomes 5.\n\nNext element is 1:\nmax_ending_here = max(1,5+1=6) \u21926. max_so_far is 6.\n\nNext element is -5:\nmax_ending_here = max(-5,6-5=1) \u21921. max_so_far remains 6.\n\nNext element is 4:\nmax_ending_here = max(4,1+4=5) \u21925. max_so_far is still 6.\n\nSo the result is 6, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: [1] should return 1. That's straightforward.\n\nThird example: [5,4,-1,7,8]\n\nLet's walk through:\n\nmax_ending_here and max_so_far start at 5.\n\nNext element 4: max(4,5+4=9) \u21929. max_so_far is 9.\n\nNext -1: max(-1,9-1=8) \u21928. max_so_far remains 9.\n\nNext 7: max(7,8+7=15) \u219215. max_so_far is now 15.\n\nNext 8: max(8,15+8=23) \u219223. max_so_far is 23.\n\nSo the result is 23, which is correct.\n\nNow, what about a case where all are negative? Like [-3, -2, -1]. The maximum should be -1.\n\nLet's see:\n\nmax_ending_here and max_so_far start at -3.\n\nNext -2: max(-2, -3-2=-5) \u2192-2. max_so_far is -2.\n\nNext -1: max(-1, -2-1=-3) \u2192-1. max_so_far is -1.\n\nSo correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nI think the steps are:\n\n- Check if the array is empty. But the problem says it's given an integer array, so maybe no need.\n\n- Initialize max_ending_here and max_so_far to the first element.\n\n- Loop from the second element to the end:\n\n   For each num in nums[1:]:\n\n      max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here + num)\n\n      if max_ending_here > max_so_far:\n\n          max_so_far = max_ending_here\n\n- Return max_so_far.\n\nWait, but in the case where all are negative, the max_so_far would be the least negative, which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\ndef maxSubArray(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0  # but according to problem, nums is given, so maybe not needed\n    max_ending_here = max_so_far = nums[0]\n    for num in nums[1:]:\n        max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here + num)\n        if max_ending_here > max_so_far:\n            max_so_far = max_ending_here\n    return max_so_far\n\nWait, but in the case where the array has only one element, it returns correctly.\n\nTesting example 2: [1] \u2192 returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think this should work.\n\nLet me test it with the first example.\n\nnums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]\n\nThe code should compute as we did earlier and return 6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum from a given integer array. This problem can be efficiently solved using Kadane's algorithm, which iteratively computes the maximum sum of subarrays ending at each position in the array.\n\n### Approach\nKadane's algorithm works by maintaining two variables:\n1. `max_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position.\n2. `max_so_far`: This variable keeps track of the overall maximum sum found so far.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize both `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far` to the first element of the array.\n2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element. For each element:\n   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element and the sum of `max_ending_here` and the current element. This decision determines whether to start a new subarray at the current element or to extend the previous subarray.\n   - Update `max_so_far` to be the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.\n3. After processing all elements, `max_so_far` will hold the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef maxSubArray(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0  # Assuming the function should return 0 for an empty array, though the problem states nums is given\n    max_ending_here = max_so_far = nums[0]\n    for num in nums[1:]:\n        max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here + num)\n        if max_ending_here > max_so_far:\n            max_so_far = max_ending_here\n    return max_so_far\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start with the first element as both the current and maximum subarray sum.\n- **Iteration**: For each subsequent element, decide whether to extend the current subarray or start a new subarray. Update the maximum sum found so far accordingly.\n- **Edge Cases**: Handles cases where all numbers are negative by ensuring the maximum subarray is the least negative number.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, making it optimal for large arrays.", "metadata": null, "timestamp": null}], "final_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a given integer array. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember there's an algorithm called Kadane's algorithm that's used for this exact problem. But wait, how does it work again? Oh right, it's about keeping track of the current maximum sum ending at each position. So for each element, I decide whether to add it to the current subarray or start a new subarray from there.\n\nLet me outline the steps. I think I'll need two variables: one to keep track of the maximum sum ending at the current position (let's call it max_ending_here), and another to keep track of the overall maximum sum found so far (max_so_far).\n\nSo, I'll initialize both max_ending_here and max_so_far to the first element of the array. Then, for each subsequent element, I'll do the following:\n\n1. Add the current element to max_ending_here. If this sum is greater than the current element itself, that means adding it to the current subarray is better. Otherwise, I'll start a new subarray with the current element.\n2. Update max_so_far to be the maximum between itself and max_ending_here. This ensures that if the current subarray's sum is the highest so far, it gets recorded.\n\nWait, but what if all numbers are negative? Oh right, the problem states that the subarray must contain at least one number, so in that case, the maximum would be the least negative number, which the algorithm should handle correctly.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first example:\n\nExample 1: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]\n\nInitialize max_ending_here and max_so_far to -2.\n\nNext element is 1:\nmax_ending_here = max(1, -2 + 1) = max(1, -1) = 1. So max_so_far becomes max(-2, 1) = 1.\n\nNext element is -3:\nmax_ending_here = max(-3, 1 + (-3)) = max(-3, -2) = -2. max_so_far remains 1.\n\nNext element is 4:\nmax_ending_here = max(4, -2 +4) = max(4,2) =4. max_so_far is now 4.\n\nNext element is -1:\nmax_ending_here = max(-1,4-1=3) \u2192 3. max_so_far is still 4.\n\nNext element is 2:\nmax_ending_here = max(2,3+2=5) \u21925. max_so_far becomes 5.\n\nNext element is 1:\nmax_ending_here = max(1,5+1=6) \u21926. max_so_far is 6.\n\nNext element is -5:\nmax_ending_here = max(-5,6-5=1) \u21921. max_so_far remains 6.\n\nNext element is 4:\nmax_ending_here = max(4,1+4=5) \u21925. max_so_far is still 6.\n\nSo the result is 6, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: [1] should return 1. That's straightforward.\n\nThird example: [5,4,-1,7,8]\n\nLet's walk through:\n\nmax_ending_here and max_so_far start at 5.\n\nNext element 4: max(4,5+4=9) \u21929. max_so_far is 9.\n\nNext -1: max(-1,9-1=8) \u21928. max_so_far remains 9.\n\nNext 7: max(7,8+7=15) \u219215. max_so_far is now 15.\n\nNext 8: max(8,15+8=23) \u219223. max_so_far is 23.\n\nSo the result is 23, which is correct.\n\nNow, what about a case where all are negative? Like [-3, -2, -1]. The maximum should be -1.\n\nLet's see:\n\nmax_ending_here and max_so_far start at -3.\n\nNext -2: max(-2, -3-2=-5) \u2192-2. max_so_far is -2.\n\nNext -1: max(-1, -2-1=-3) \u2192-1. max_so_far is -1.\n\nSo correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nI think the steps are:\n\n- Check if the array is empty.

If no profit is possible, return 0.\n\nHmm. So the first thought is, I need to find the maximum difference between a later price and an earlier price. But I can't just look for any two points; the sell day has to be after the buy day.\n\nLet me think about the examples given.\n\nIn example 1: [7,1,5,3,6,4].

Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize min_price to the first element of the array.\n2. Initialize max_profit to 0.\n3. Iterate through each price starting from the second element:\n   a.

Wait no: wait, in this case, the code would have:\n\nmin_price=2.\n\nprice=1: min becomes1. current_profit 0. So max_profit is0.\n\nBut the actual possible profit is -1, but since we can't have negative profit, the code correctly returns0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says to return the maximum profit possible. So if all possible transactions result in a loss, we return0.\n\nSo the code correctly returns0.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,4,2,5,7,2,4,9,0]. The maximum profit is 9-0=9? Wait no, because you can't sell after buying. Wait, the array is 1,2,4,2,5,7,2,4,9,0.\n\nThe best is to buy at 0 (price0) and sell at 9 (price9), but wait, 0 is the last element. So no, the best is to buy at 2 (price2) and sell at 9 (price9), which is 7 profit.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe array is [1,2,4,2,5,7,2,4,9,0].\n\nThe maximum profit is 9-0=9, but wait, the buy has to be before sell. So the 0 is at the end, so you can't sell after that.\n\nWait, in the array, the 9 is at index8, and 0 is at index9. So the maximum profit is 9-0=9, but since you can't buy at 0 and sell after, that's not allowed. So the maximum is actually 9-2=7, where you buy at index3 (price2) and sell at index8 (price9).\n\nSo the code should return7.\n\nLet's see how the code processes this.\n\nInitialize min_price=1.\n\nprice=2: current_profit 1. max=1.\n\nprice=4: current_profit 3. max=3.\n\nprice=2: min becomes2. current_profit0. max remains3.\n\nprice=5: current_profit3. max remains3.\n\nprice=7: current_profit5. max becomes5.\n\nprice=2: min becomes2. current_profit0.\n\nprice=4: current_profit2. max remains5.\n\nprice", "metadata": null, "timestamp": null}], "final_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum profit from a single stock transaction.

So max_profit is 0.\n- Day 3 (5): min_price is 1. current_profit is 4. So max_profit is 4.\n- Day4 (3): current_profit is 2. Max remains 4.\n- Day5 (6): current_profit is 5. Max becomes 5.\n- Day6 (4): current_profit is 3. Max remains 5.\n\nSo the result is 5, which is correct.\n\nExample 2: [7,6,4,3,1]\n\n- min_price starts at7.\n- Day2 (6): min becomes6. current_profit 0. Max is 0.\n- Day3 (4): min becomes4. current_profit 0. Max remains 0.\n- Day4 (3): min becomes3. current_profit 0. Max 0.\n- Day5 (1): min becomes1. current_profit 0. Max 0.\n\nSo the result is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [2,1,2,0,1]. Let's see.\n\nThe array is 2,1,2,0,1.\n\nThe best is to buy at 0 (price 0) and sell at 1 (price1), profit 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitialize min_price =2.\n\nDay2 (1): min becomes1. current_profit 0. Max 0.\n\nDay3 (2): current_profit 1. Max is1.\n\nDay4 (0): min becomes0. current_profit 0.\n\nDay5 (1): current_profit 1-0=1. Max remains1.\n\nWait, but the actual maximum is 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [3,2,6,5,0,3]. Let's see.\n\nThe array is 3,2,6,5,0,3.\n\nThe best is to buy at 2 (price2) and sell at 6 (price6), but wait, the array is 3,2,6,5,0,3.\n\nWait, the days are 0-based or 1-based? The problem says \"ith day\", so probably 0-based.\n\nWait, in the array [3,2,6,5,0,3], the best is to buy at index1 (price2) and sell at index2 (price6), profit 4.\n\nLet's see how the algorithm would process this.\n\nmin_price starts at3.\n\nDay1 (2): min becomes2. current_profit 0. Max 0.\n\nDay2 (6): current_profit 4. Max is4.\n\nDay3 (5): current_profit 3. Max remains4.\n\nDay4 (0): min becomes0. current_profit 0.\n\nDay5 (3): current_profit 3. Max becomes4 vs 3? No, so max remains4.\n\nSo the algorithm correctly returns4.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\n- Check if the array is empty or has less than 2 elements. If so, return 0.\n\n- Initialize min_price as the first element.\n\n- Initialize max_profit as 0.\n\n- Iterate from the second element to the end:\n\n   for price in prices[1:]:\n\n       if price < min_price:\n\n           min_price = price\n\n       current_profit = price - min_price\n\n       if current_profit > max_profit:\n\n           max_profit = current_profit\n\n- Return max_profit.\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial max_profit is 0, which is correct because if all possible profits are negative, the max remains 0.\n\nSo, let's write the code.\n\nTesting the code with example1:\n\nprices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\n\nmax_profit starts at 0.\n\nmin_price =7.\n\nThen, price=1: min becomes1. current_profit 0. max remains0.\n\nprice=5: current_profit 4. max becomes4.\n\nprice=3: current_profit 2. max remains4.\n\nprice=6: current_profit5. max becomes5.\n\nprice=4: current_profit3. max remains5.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother test case: [2,1], should return1-2= -1, but since max_profit is 0, it returns0? Wait no: wait, in this case, the code would have:\n\nmin_price=2.\n\nprice=1: min becomes1. current_profit 0. So max_profit is0.\n\nBut the actual possible profit is -1, but since we can't have negative profit, the code correctly returns0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says to return the maximum profit possible. So if all possible transactions result in a loss, we return0.\n\nSo the code correctly returns0.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,4,2,5,7,2,4,9,0]. The maximum profit is 9-0=9? Wait no, because you can't sell after buying. Wait, the array is 1,2,4,2,5,7,2,4,9,0.\n\nThe best is to buy at 0 (price0) and sell at 9 (price9), but wait, 0 is the last element. So no, the best is to buy at 2 (price2) and sell at 9 (price9), which is 7 profit.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe array is [1,2,4,2,5,7,2,4,9,0].\n\nThe maximum profit is 9-0=9, but wait, the buy has to be before sell. So the 0 is at the end, so you can't sell after that.\n\nWait, in the array, the 9 is at index8, and 0 is at index9. So the maximum profit is 9-0=9, but since you can't buy at 0 and sell after, that's not allowed. So the maximum is actually 9-2=7, where you buy at index3 (price2) and sell at index8 (price9).\n\nSo the code should return7.\n\nLet's see how the code processes this.\n\nInitialize min_price=1.\n\nprice=2: current_profit 1. max=1.\n\nprice=4: current_profit 3. max=3.\n\nprice=2: min becomes2. current_profit0. max remains3.\n\nprice=5: current_profit3. max remains3.\n\nprice=7: current_profit5. max becomes5.\n\nprice=2: min becomes2. current_profit0.\n\nprice=4: current_profit2. max remains5.\n\nprice", "success": true, "total_tokens": 2421, "execution_time": 46.112128019332886, "metadata": {"tools_used": [], "step_count": 1}}, "generated_at": "2025-05-29T13:46:49.188254"}
