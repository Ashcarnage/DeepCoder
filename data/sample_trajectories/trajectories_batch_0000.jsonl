Otherwise, I adjust the low pointer to mid+1.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize low = 0, high = len(nums) - 1.\n2. While low <= high:\n   a. mid = (low + high) // 2\n   b. if nums[mid] == target, return mid\n   c. elif nums[mid] > target, set high = mid -1\n   d. else, set low = mid +1\n3. If the loop ends without finding, return -1.\n\nWait, but what about edge cases? Like when the array is empty? Well, in that case, the function should return -1 immediately. Or if the target is at the very beginning or end.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nExample 1: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target=9.\nlow starts at 0, high at 5.\nmid = 2, value is 3. 9 is larger, so low becomes 3.\nNext iteration: low=3, high=5. mid=4, value is 9. Found, return 4. Correct.\n\nExample 2: target=2. Let's see:\nlow=0, high=5. mid=2, value 3. 2 <3, so high=1.\nNow low=0, high=1. mid=0, value -1. 2 >-1, so low=1.\nNow low=1, high=1. mid=1, value 0. 2>0, so low=2. Now low>high, loop ends. Return -1. Correct.\n\nWhat about when the target is the first element? Like target=-1 in example 1. The first mid would be 2, but wait, no. Let me see: low=0, high=5. mid=2, which is 3. Target is -1, which is less than 3, so high becomes 1. Then mid becomes 0, which is -1. So returns 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: target is 12. The loop would proceed until mid reaches 5, and return 5.\n\nWhat if the array has duplicates? Oh, but the problem doesn't specify handling duplicates, just to return the index if it exists. So as long as the target is present, any occurrence's index is acceptable, but since the array is sorted, it will find one.\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple same elements? Like [2,2,2,2], target=2. The function will return the first mid it finds, which might be in the middle, but since all are same, any index is correct.\n\nSo, I think this logic should handle all cases.\n\nNow, I need to write this in Python.\n\nThe function will take nums and target as parameters. First, handle the case where nums is empty? Well, if len(nums) is 0, return -1.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the examples have nums as non-empty, but the function should handle empty arrays gracefully.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\ndef search(nums, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(nums) - 1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if nums[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif nums[mid] > target:\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return -1\n\nLet me test this code with the examples.\n\nExample 1: returns 4. Correct.\n\nExample 2: returns -1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [1], target=1. Should return 0.\n\nAnother test: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], target=3. Should return 2.\n\nYes, the code should handle these.\n\nI think this should work. So the final answer is to implement this binary search approach.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to efficiently search for a target value in a sorted array of integers. The solution must achieve a time complexity of O(log n), which makes binary search the optimal approach.\n\n### Approach\nThe binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `low` set to the start of the array (index 0) and `high` set to the end of the array (index `len(nums) - 1`).\n\n2. **Loop Until Pointers Meet**: Continue the search while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.\n\n3. **Calculate Midpoint**: In each iteration, compute the middle index (`mid`) of the current search interval.\n\n4. **Check Midpoint Value**:\n   - If the value at `mid` is equal to the target, return `mid` as the index where the target is found.\n   - If the value at `mid` is greater than the target, adjust the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to search the left half.\n   - If the value at `mid` is less than the target, adjust the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search the right half.\n\n5. **Return -1 if Not Found**: If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the target is not present in the array.\n\nThis approach ensures that each step effectively halves the search space, leading to the desired logarithmic time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef search(nums, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(nums) - 1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if nums[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif nums[mid] > target:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe binary search algorithm efficiently narrows down the search space by comparing the target value with the middle element of the current search interval. Each comparison reduces the problem size by half, ensuring that the solution runs in O(log n) time. This method is optimal for searching in sorted arrays and handles all edge cases, including when the target is at the boundaries or not present in the array.", "metadata": null, "timestamp": null}], "final_answer": "def search(nums, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(nums) - 1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if nums[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif nums[mid] > target:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return -1", "success": true, "total_tokens": 1883, "execution_time": 9.14779782295227, "metadata": {"tools_used": [], "step_count": 1}}, "generated_at": "2025-05-29T13:45:43.555487"}
