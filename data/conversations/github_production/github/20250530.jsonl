Inspired by swarm intelligence principles, it features multiple specialized AI agents (**Assistant**, **Researcher**, **Planner**) that collaborate dynamically to handle user queries. The system incorporates a belief mechanism, allowing agents to assess each other's reliability over time, influencing communication success and task delegation. Users interact via a **Streamlit web interface**, which communicates with a **FastAPI backend**. The system supports tool usage (**Calculator**, **Web Search**, **ArXiv Search**) and allows users to upload PDF documents for context-aware interactions. This architecture enables complex task decomposition, specialized expertise, and potential resilience beyond monolithic chatbot models.\n\n---\n\n## **Motivation**   \n---\n\nTraditional chatbots often employ a single, large language model (LLM) to handle all types of user queries. While powerful, this monolithic approach can struggle with:\n\n- **Specialized Tasks:** A generalist model might lack the depth or specific tools needed for tasks like complex calculations, academic research, or structured planning.\n- **Scalability:** Integrating diverse new capabilities (tools, knowledge domains) into a single model can be complex and require extensive retraining.\n- **Resilience:** A single point of failure can render the entire system unusable.\n- **Context Management:** Effectively utilizing vast amounts of context (like large documents) alongside conversational history can be challenging for a single model.\n\nThis project explores a Multi-Agent System approach to overcome these limitations. By creating specialized agents with distinct capabilities and tools, and enabling them to collaborate dynamically using swarm intelligence principles, we aim to build a more robust, adaptable, and capable conversational AI system. The belief mechanism adds a layer of dynamic adaptation based on observed agent performance.\n\n---\n\n## **System Architecture** \n---\n\nThe system comprises several key components interacting asynchronously:\n\n- **Streamlit Frontend (app.py):** User interface for registration, login, chat interaction, and PDF file upload.\n- **FastAPI Backend (main.py):** Handles API requests (user auth, chat), manages user sessions, interacts with the database, processes file uploads, and interfaces with the Multi-Agent System.\n- **Multi-Agent System (swarm_system.py):** Orchestrates the overall agent swarm. Initializes agents, manages belief parameters, and initiates tasks by routing them to an appropriate starting agent.\n- **Agent (agent.py):** Represents individual agents (Assistant, Researcher, Planner). Contains the core logic for task analysis, decision-making (local execution vs. delegation), tool usage, communication (sending/receiving messages), and belief management.\n- **LLM Service (api_service.py):** Wraps the interaction with the external LLM API (GitHub Models in this case), handling request formatting and response parsing.\n- **Tools (tools.py):** Defines and implements specialized functions (Web Search, Calculator, ArXiv Search) that agents can utilize. Encapsulated in MCPTool class.\n- **Database (database.py):** Uses  PostgreSQL  to store user credentials and chat history.\n- **Authentication (auth.py):** Provides password hashing and verification utilities.\n- **Configuration (config.py):** Manages settings using Pydantic, loading from environment variables or a .env file.\n\nBelow is a visual and textual representation of the system architecture (originally a Mermaid diagram and its image ):\n\n### **Agent Workflow Diagram**  \n![Agent Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/Adithyan773/Decentralized-Multi-Agent-Swarm-Chat-System-DELVIN-AI-/raw/main/images/swarm_system.png)\n  \n*Illustration of the swarm agent system and process.*\n\n```\nUser interacts/uploads to Streamlit Frontend\nStreamlit Frontend sends HTTP requests (Login/Chat/File) to FastAPI Backend\nFastAPI Backend accesses Database for auth/history\nFastAPI Backend sends user query/file content to Multi-Agent System\nMulti-Agent System initiates task to Agent 1\nAgent 1 analyzes/decides with LLM API Service\nAgent 1 delegates task probabilistically to Agent 2\nAgent 2 analyzes/decides with LLM API Service\nAgent 1 and Agent 2 use Tools as needed\nTools access External Services for data\nAgents generate responses via LLM API Service\nAgent 2 returns result to Agent 1\nAgent 1 synthesizes final response to Multi-Agent System\nMulti-Agent System returns response to FastAPI Backend\nFastAPI Backend stores history in Database\nFastAPI Backend sends HTTP response to Streamlit Frontend\nStreamlit Frontend displays response to User\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Core Components Deep Dive**  \n---\n\n### **FastAPI Backend (main.py)**  \n**Role:** Serves as the main API gateway.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n- Defines API endpoints for `/register`, `/login`, `/chat`.\n- Handles user authentication using simple username/password verification against the database (no tokens used post-login, relies on `user_id` in requests).\n- Manages database sessions (`get_db` dependency).\n- Receives chat requests (`ChatRequest` model), including optional Base64 encoded file content and filename.\n- **File Processing:** If a file is included, it decodes the Base64 content, uses `pypdf` to extract text from the PDF bytes, and handles potential errors during this process. Includes request size limiting middleware.\n- Fetches recent chat history from the database for context.\n- Interfaces with the `MultiAgentSystem` (`mas.initiate_task`), passing the user query, chat context, and extracted file text.\n- Stores user messages and final swarm responses in the database.\n- Returns the final response to the frontend (`ChatResponse` model).\n\n### **Streamlit Frontend (app.py)**  \n**Role:** Provides the interactive user interface.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n- Uses Streamlit widgets (`st.chat_input`, `st.chat_message`, `st.sidebar`, `st.form`, `st.file_uploader`).\n- Manages session state (`st.session_state`) to track login status (`user_id`, `username`), current chat messages, and the uploaded file object.\n- Handles user registration and login by calling the respective FastAPI endpoints.\n- **File Upload:** Allows users to upload PDF files. Stores the uploaded file object. When a chat message is sent:\n  - Reads the file bytes.\n  - Encodes bytes to Base64.\n  - Includes the Base64 string and filename in the `/chat` request payload.\n- Displays the chat history for the current session.\n- Sends user prompts (and potentially file data) to the FastAPI `/chat` endpoint.\n- Displays the response received from the backend, including error messages and response times.\n\n### **Multi-Agent System (swarm_system.py)**  \n**Role:** Manages the collection of agents and high-level swarm parameters.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n- Initializes the `semantic_kernel` instance and adds the `GitHubModelsChatService`.\n- Instantiates the individual `Agent` objects (`assistant`, `researcher`, `planner`) with their specific system prompts, capabilities, tools, and swarm parameters (`gamma`, `phi_min`, `link_efficiency`, `comm_timeout`).\n- Holds references to all created agents (`self.agents` dictionary).\n- Provides `agents_dict_ref` to each agent for peer awareness.\n- Initializes the belief system for all agents (`finalize_agent_setup`).\n- `initiate_task`: Selects a starting agent (round-robin for simplicity), and calls its `process_task` method, passing the initial query, user context, and file content/name.\n\n### **Agent Logic (agent.py)**  \n**Role:** Defines the behavior and capabilities of an individual agent. This is the core intelligence unit.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n- **Initialization:** Stores its name, capability, tools, system prompt, kernel instance, swarm parameters, and a reference to the global agent dictionary.\n- **Belief Management:**\n  - `initialize_beliefs`: Sets initial belief in all agents to 1.0.\n  - `decay_beliefs`: Applies time-based exponential decay to beliefs about other agents using the `gamma` parameter.\n  - `update_belief`: Adjusts belief about another agent based on interaction outcomes (e.g., successful communication sets belief to 1.0, failures penalize belief), clamped between `phi_min` and 1.0.\n- `process_task`: The main execution loop for an agent.\n  - Determines if analysis is needed (`_should_analyze_for_delegation`).\n  - If analysis is needed, calls `analyze_and_plan_task`.\n  - If no delegation is planned (or analysis skipped), calls `execute_local_task`.\n  - If delegation is planned:\n    - Calls `send_message` to communicate with the target agent.\n    - Waits (`asyncio.wait_for`) for the response or timeout.\n    - Handles communication success, failure, or timeout (updating beliefs accordingly).\n    - Calls `_synthesize_delegation_results` to process the peer's response.\n- `analyze_and_plan_task`:\n  - Uses the LLM to decide whether to handle the task locally or delegate.\n  - Constructs a detailed prompt including the agent's identity, task, context (chat history, file presence), its own tools, peer agents' capabilities/tools/beliefs, and recent delegation history.\n  - Instructs the LLM to prioritize file content, then its own tools, then delegation.\n  - Requires the LLM to respond in a specific JSON format indicating the decision (reasoning, delegation target/sub-task if any).\n  - Parses the LLM response and validates the delegation plan (including loopback prevention using `_validate_delegation_plan`).\n- `execute_local_task`:\n  - Handles the task directly if analysis determined local execution or as a fallback.\n  - Includes simplified heuristics to select a tool if appropriate (e.g., calculator for math).\n  - Constructs a prompt for the LLM, including system prompt, chat history, file content (if available), the task description, and potentially the results of a tool execution.\n  - Instructs the LLM to prioritize file content if relevant.\n  - Calls the LLM via the `GitHubModelsChatService`.\n  - Returns the LLM's response or an error message.\n- **Communication:**\n  - `send_message`: Sends a task delegation message probabilistically based on belief (`current_belief * link_efficiency`). Creates an `asyncio.Task` for the receiving agent's `handle_incoming_message`.\n  - `handle_incoming_message`: Processes messages received from other agents, extracts task details (including file info), updates belief about the sender to 1.0, and calls `process_task` for the delegated sub-task.\n- `_synthesize_delegation_results`: Uses the LLM to combine the result received from a peer agent with the original task context (including file context summary) to generate a final, coherent answer for the agent's original task.\n\n### **API Service (api_service.py)**  \n**Role:** Provides a standardized interface to the LLM backend.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n- `GitHubModelsChatService` class inherits from Semantic Kernel's `ChatCompletionClientBase`.\n- `complete_chat_async`:\n  - Takes a `ChatHistory` object and settings.\n  - Formats the chat history into the JSON structure required by the GitHub Models API.\n  - Sets parameters like `model`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `response_format`.\n  - Sends the request using the `requests` library, including the API key in the headers.\n  - Handles potential HTTP errors, timeouts, JSON decoding errors, and unexpected API responses.\n  - Parses the successful response to extract the message content.\n\n### **Tools (tools.py)**  \n**Role:** Defines reusable functions that agents can leverage.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n- `MCPTool` class: A simple wrapper to store the tool's name, description (used in agent prompts), and the callable function. Includes a `to_dict` method for potential future integration with OpenAI-style function calling.\n- **Individual tool functions:**\n  - `web_search_tool`: Uses the `googlesearch-python` library for web searches and `requests/BeautifulSoup` to scrape and summarize content from top results. Includes basic error handling and content extraction logic.\n  - `math_calculator`: Uses Python's `eval()` (with safety precautions) to calculate mathematical expressions. Allows basic arithmetic and specific math functions (`abs`, `min`, `max`, etc.). Includes checks for disallowed characters/patterns.\n  - `arxiv_search`: Uses the `arxiv` library to search for scientific papers on the ArXiv repository, formatting the results clearly.\n- `AVAILABLE_TOOLS` dictionary: Maps tool names to their `MCPTool` instances, allowing agents to easily look up and use available tools.\n\n### **Database (database.py) & Auth (auth.py)**  \n**Role:** Data persistence and basic authentication helpers.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n- **database.py:**\n  - Uses SQLAlchemy ORM to define `User` and `ChatHistory` models.\n  - Configures the database connection (SQLite default, configurable via `DATABASE_URL`).\n  - Provides functions (`create_database_tables`, `get_db`, `get_user_by_username`, `get_user_by_id`, `add_chat_message`, `get_chat_history`) for interacting with the database.\n- **auth.py:**\n  - Provides `get_password_hash` and `verify_password` functions using `passlib` for secure password handling.\n\n### **Configuration (config.py)**  \n**Role:** Centralized application settings management.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n- Uses Pydantic's `BaseSettings` to load configuration from environment variables or a `.env` file.\n- Defines settings like API keys, model IDs, database URL, swarm parameters (`DEFAULT_GAMMA`, `DEFAULT_PHI_MIN`, etc.), logging levels, and timeouts.\n\n---\n\n## **Swarm Intelligence Implementation**  \n---\n\n### **Concept Overview**  \nThis project leverages concepts from **Swarm Intelligence (SI)** to enable collaboration between specialized agents. SI studies the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, often inspired by natural systems like ant colonies or bird flocks. Key principles applied here are:\n\n- **Decentralization:** Control is distributed among agents, rather than residing in a single central authority.\n- **Specialization:** Agents have distinct capabilities and tools (Assistant, Researcher, Planner).\n- **Indirect Communication/Coordination:** While direct messaging exists, the belief system acts as a form of indirect coordination, guiding future interactions based on past performance.\n- **Adaptation:** The belief system allows the swarm to adapt, favoring more reliable agents over time.\n\n### **The Belief System: Modeling Trust and Reliability**  \nA crucial element of the swarm implementation is the belief system, where each agent maintains a trust score (**belief, \u03a6**) for every other agent. This allows the system to dynamically adapt its communication and delegation strategies based on perceived reliability.\n\n#### **Parameters**  \n- **Gamma (\u03b3):** The belief decay rate. A higher gamma means beliefs decay faster over time if there's no interaction, signifying that past positive interactions become less relevant more quickly.\n- **Phi_min (\u03a6_min):** The minimum belief value an agent can hold about another. This prevents beliefs from dropping to zero, ensuring there's always a small chance of interaction even with agents that have failed previously. It represents a baseline level of potential capability or a chance for redemption.\n- **Link Efficiency (L):** A multiplier affecting the probability of successful communication based on belief. `L >= 1.0` forces success (useful for debugging or specific scenarios), while `L < 1.0` makes communication probabilistic.\n\n#### **Belief Decay (Mathematical Basis)**  \nWhen an agent hasn't interacted with another agent, its belief in that agent decays exponentially over time. The `decay_beliefs` method implements this using the formula:\n\n```\nnew_belief = \u03a6_min + (current_belief - \u03a6_min) * exp(-\u03b3 * time_delta)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n- `new_belief`: The updated belief value after decay.\n- `current_belief`: The agent's belief score before decay.\n- `\u03a6_min`: The minimum possible belief value.\n- `\u03b3`: The decay rate parameter.\n- `time_delta`: The time elapsed since the last belief update for that specific agent.\n- `exp()`: The exponential function (e^x).\n\nThis formula ensures that the belief decays towards `\u03a6_min` but never falls below it. The rate of decay is controlled by `\u03b3`.\n\n#### **Belief Updates (Success/Failure)**  \nBeliefs are actively updated based on interaction outcomes:\n\n- **Successful Communication:** When an agent successfully receives a message from another agent (in `handle_incoming_message`), it updates its belief in the sender to 1.0. This reinforces trust after a successful interaction.\n- **Communication Failure (Probabilistic):** If a message dispatch fails the probabilistic check in `send_message`, the sending agent penalizes its belief in the target agent (e.g., `new_belief = max(\u03a6_min, current_belief * 0.75)`).\n- **Timeout:** If waiting for a delegated task result times out, the requesting agent harshly penalizes its belief in the target agent (e.g., `new_belief = max(\u03a6_min, current_belief * 0.5)`).\n- **Other Errors:** Exceptions during result processing also lead to belief penalties.\n\n### **Probabilistic Communication**  \nThe success of sending a message between agents isn\u2019t guaranteed (unless `link_efficiency >= 1.0`). It depends on the sender\u2019s current belief in the receiver and the `link_efficiency` parameter:\n\n```\nP(Success) = max(0.0, min(current_belief * link_efficiency, 1.0))\n```\n\nA random number is compared against this probability. This simulates potential unreliability or communication channel noise inherent in decentralized systems and encourages the system to favor agents it currently trusts more.\n\n### **Intelligent Task Delegation**  \nInstead of simple round-robin or fixed routing, task delegation is decided dynamically by the agent currently holding the task (`analyze_and_plan_task`). The agent uses an LLM to:\n\n- Assess if it can handle the task itself (using file content or its tools).\n- If not, evaluate available peers based on their advertised capabilities/tools **AND** the current belief (\u03a6) in them.\n- Select the single best peer deemed most suitable and reliable.\n- Formulate a specific sub-task for the chosen peer.\n- Avoid immediate loopback (delegating back to the agent that just sent the task).\n\nThis LLM-driven analysis, informed by the dynamic belief system, allows for more intelligent and context-aware task routing than simple hardcoded rules.\n\n---\n\n## **Agent Workflow Example**   \n---\n\nLet\u2019s trace a query like: **\"Summarize the key findings about reinforcement learning in the uploaded paper and then search for recent news about AlphaFold.\"**\n\n1. **User Input:** User uploads `rl_paper.pdf` and enters the query in the Streamlit app.\n2. **Frontend (app.py):** Encodes the PDF to Base64, sends the query, user ID, Base64 content, and filename (`rl_paper.pdf`) to the FastAPI `/chat` endpoint.\n3. **Backend (main.py):**\n   - Receives the request, validates the user ID.\n   - Decodes the Base64 content.\n   - Uses `pypdf` to extract text from `rl_paper.pdf`. Stores the text.\n   - Fetches recent chat history.\n   - Calls `mas.initiate_task` with the query, history, extracted text, and filename.\n4. **Swarm System (swarm_system.py):** Selects a starting agent, e.g., `assistant`. Calls `assistant.process_task`.\n5. **Agent (assistant.process_task):**\n   - Sees the task is complex (\"summarize\", \"search news\") and involves a file. Determines analysis is needed (`_should_analyze_for_delegation`).\n   - Calls `assistant.analyze_and_plan_task`.\n6. **Agent (assistant.analyze_and_plan_task):**\n   - Prepares a prompt for the LLM including: \"My task is complex... I have file content from 'rl_paper.pdf'. Peers are 'researcher' [High Belief, Tools: search, arxiv] and 'planner' [High Belief, Tools: None]. My tools: [calculator]. Should I handle this or delegate?\"\n   - The LLM responds (in JSON): `{\"reasoning\": \"Task requires planning for multi-step query involving file and search. Delegating to Planner.\", \"delegations\": [{\"agent_name\": \"planner\", \"task\": \"User wants a summary of the provided RL paper and recent news on AlphaFold. Plan and delegate execution.\", \"capability_needed\": \"planner\"}]}`\n7. **Agent (assistant.process_task cont.):**\n   - Sees a delegation plan for `planner`.\n   - Calls `assistant.send_message` targeting `planner`, including the sub-task, original query, history, file content, and filename in the message payload.\n8. **Agent (assistant.send_message):** Checks belief in `planner`, calculates `P(Success)`. Assuming success, creates a task for `planner.handle_incoming_message`.\n9. **Agent (planner.handle_incoming_message):** Receives message, updates belief in `assistant` to 1.0. Calls `planner.process_task` with the sub-task.\n10. **Agent (planner.process_task):**\n    - Always analyzes. Calls `planner.analyze_and_plan_task`.\n11. **Agent (planner.analyze_and_plan_task):**\n    - LLM Prompt: \"My task is to plan execution for 'Summarize RL paper, then search AlphaFold news'. File provided. Peers: Assistant [Belief: 1.0, Tools: calc], Researcher [Belief: 0.9, Tools: search, arxiv]. How to delegate?\"\n    - LLM Response: `{\"reasoning\": \"Breaking down task. Delegating file summary to Assistant (best for direct file use), then news search to Researcher.\", \"delegations\": [{\"agent_name\": \"assistant\", \"task\": \"Summarize the key findings about reinforcement learning based *only* on the provided file content from 'rl_paper.pdf'.\", \"capability_needed\": \"assistant\"}]}`\n12. **Agent (planner.process_task cont.):** Delegates the summarization task to `assistant`. Sends message (including file content). Waits for response.\n13. **Agent (assistant.handle_incoming_message):** Receives summary task. Calls `assistant.process_task`.\n14. **Agent (assistant.process_task):** Analyzes/decides to handle locally using the file. Calls `assistant.execute_local_task`.\n15. **Agent (assistant.execute_local_task):** Sends prompt to LLM with file content: \"Summarize key RL findings from this text...\". Gets summary back.\n16. **Agent (assistant.process_task cont.):** Returns the summary result to `planner`.\n17. **Agent (planner.process_task cont.):** Receives summary. Now delegates the second part. Delegates \"Search for recent news about AlphaFold\" to `researcher`. Sends message.\n18. **Agent (researcher.handle_incoming_message):** Receives search task. Calls `researcher.process_task`.\n19. **Agent (researcher.process_task):** Analyzes/decides to handle locally. Calls `researcher.execute_local_task`.\n20. **Agent (researcher.execute_local_task):** Uses `web_search_tool` with query \"recent news about AlphaFold\". Gets results. Sends prompt to LLM: \"Based on these search results, provide the final answer...\". Gets synthesized search results.\n21. **Agent (researcher.process_task cont.):** Returns search results to `planner`.\n22. **Agent (planner.process_task cont.):** Receives search results. Calls `planner._synthesize_delegation_results`.\n23. **Agent (planner._synthesize_delegation_results):** Sends prompt to LLM: \"Original task was X. Assistant provided summary Y. Researcher provided search results Z. Combine these...\". Gets final combined answer.\n24. **Agent (planner.process_task cont.):** Returns the final combined answer to `assistant`.\n25. **Agent (assistant.process_task cont.):** Receives the final answer from `planner`. Returns final answer.\n26. **Swarm System (initiate_task):** Receives the final answer from `assistant`.\n27. **Backend (main.py):** Gets the final answer, stores it in the database, and sends it back to the frontend.\n28. **Frontend (app.py):** Displays the final answer to the user.\n\n## **Project Frontend demo** \n![Agent Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/Adithyan773/Decentralized-Multi-Agent-Swarm-Chat-System-DELVIN-AI-/raw/main/images/demo1.png) \n*Illustration of the frontend interaction .*\n\n## **Project Backend demo** \n![Agent Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/Adithyan773/Decentralized-Multi-Agent-Swarm-Chat-System-DELVIN-AI-/raw/main/images/demo2.png) \n*Illustration of the backend interaction and task delegation process.*\n\n## **Agent Workflow Example** \n![Agent Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/Adithyan773/Decentralized-Multi-Agent-Swarm-Chat-System-DELVIN-AI-/raw/main/images/agent_workflow.png)  \n*Illustration of the agent interaction and task delegation process.*\n\n---\n\n## **File Handling Feature** \n---\n\nA key enhancement is the ability to incorporate user-uploaded PDF documents into the conversation:\n\n- **Upload (Frontend):** `app.py` uses `st.file_uploader` to accept a PDF.\n- **Encoding (Frontend):** The file content is read as bytes and encoded into a Base64 string.\n- **Transmission (API):** The Base64 string and filename are included in the JSON payload sent to the `/chat` endpoint in `main.py`.\n- **Decoding & Parsing (Backend):** `main.py` decodes the Base64 string back into bytes. It then uses the `pypdf` library (`PdfReader`) to read the PDF from these bytes and extract text content page by page. Robust error handling is included for invalid encoding or corrupted/unreadable PDFs.\n- **Context Injection (Swarm/Agent):** The extracted text and original filename are passed through the `MultiAgentSystem` to the initial `Agent`.\n- **Agent Utilization:**\n  - The presence and name of the file are included in the analysis prompt (`analyze_and_plan_task`) to help the LLM decide if the task can be handled locally using the file or if delegation/tools are needed.\n  - The full extracted text (potentially truncated for context window limits) is included in the prompt for local execution (`execute_local_task`), allowing the agent\u2019s LLM to directly reference and use the file\u2019s content.\n  - File content and name are included in delegation messages (`send_message`, `handle_incoming_message`) so receiving agents also have the necessary context.\n  - Synthesis prompts (`_synthesize_delegation_results`) also include a summary of the file context for generating the final answer.\n\nThis allows users to ask specific questions about documents, request summaries, or use the document content as context for more complex queries involving other tools.\n\n---\n\n## **Advantages Over Standard Chatbots**  \n---\n\nThis Multi-Agent Swarm approach offers several advantages compared to traditional monolithic chatbots:\n\n- **Specialization & Expertise:** Agents are designed for specific capabilities (planning, research, assistance) and equipped with relevant tools. A researcher using `arxiv_search` will likely outperform a generalist LLM for finding specific scientific papers.\n- **Task Decomposition:** Complex queries requiring multiple steps or types of information (e.g., calculation + web search + file summary) can be broken down by the planner and delegated to the appropriate specialized agents.\n- **Enhanced Tool Integration:** Tools are assigned to specific agents that are designed to use them effectively. This modular approach makes it easier to add new tools \u2013 simply create a new tool function and potentially a new specialized agent or assign it to an existing relevant one.\n- **Adaptability & Resilience (via Beliefs):** The belief system allows the swarm to dynamically adapt. If a particular agent consistently fails or times out, other agents\u2019 belief in it will decrease, making them less likely to delegate tasks to it, routing work towards more reliable peers. While not full fault tolerance, this adds a layer of dynamic optimization.\n- **Scalability & Modularity:** The system is inherently modular. Adding new capabilities can involve adding new agents or tools without necessarily requiring modifications to unrelated agents, potentially simplifying development and maintenance compared to retraining a massive monolithic model.\n- **Focused Context:** While the entire system handles diverse information (chat history, files, tool results), individual LLM calls within agents can be more focused. For example, `execute_local_task` primarily focuses on the specific sub-task, relevant history, and potentially file/tool results, rather than needing the entire global state in every prompt.\n\n---\n\n## **Running the Project**   \n---\n\n### **Prerequisites**  \n- **Python 3.9+**\n- **pip** (Python package installer)\n- **Git** (for cloning, optional)\n\n**Install Dependencies:**\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### **Environment Variables**  \nFirst, create a virtual environment and activate it:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS\n# For Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n```\n\nThen, create a `.env` file with the following content:\n\n```bash\n# LLM API Configuration\nGITHUB_API_KEY=\"ghp_YOUR_GITHUB_FINE_GRAINED_PAT_WITH_MODELS_ACCESS\" # Replace with your key\nDEFAULT_MODEL_ID=\"gpt-4o-mini\" # Or another model compatible with the endpoint\n\n# Database setup, Example for PostgreSQL:\n# DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name\"\n\n# Swarm Parameters (Optional - Defaults are in config.py)\n# DEFAULT_GAMMA=0.05\n# DEFAULT_PHI_MIN=0.1\n# DEFAULT_LINK_EFFICIENCY=1.0 # 1.0 forces successful communication\n# COMM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120\n\n# FastAPI Backend URL (for Streamlit)\nFASTAPI_BACKEND_URL=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000\"\n\n# Logging (Optional)\nMAX_LOG_LEN=200\n```\n\n### **Running the Application**  \n**Backend:**\n\n```bash\nfastapi run main.py\n# Or\nuvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload\n```\n\n**Frontend:**\n\n```bash\nstreamlit run app.py\n```\n\n---\n## **Future Work**\n---\n- **More Sophisticated Belief Models:** Implement Bayesian belief updates or models considering task success/failure quality, not just communication success.\n- **Dynamic Agent Creation/Scaling:** Allow the system to spin up new agent instances based on load or task type.\n- **Advanced Tooling:** Integrate more complex tools (code execution, database querying, more APIs). Implement more robust tool selection logic, potentially using an LLM call specifically for tool choice.\n- **Parallel Delegation:** Allow the planner agent to delegate multiple sub-tasks concurrently.\n- **Improved Error Handling & Fallbacks:** More graceful handling of LLM errors, tool failures, and agent timeouts.\n- **User Feedback Loop:** Allow users to rate responses, potentially feeding back into the belief system.\n- **Enhanced UI:** Improve the Streamlit UI with features like displaying agent activity/delegation paths, managing multiple files, etc.\n\n---\n## **Conclusion**  \n---\n\nThis **Decentralized Multi-Agent Swarm Chat System** demonstrates a powerful alternative to traditional chatbots. By leveraging agent specialization, dynamic task delegation, and a trust-based belief system, it can handle complex, multi-faceted queries involving specialized tools and user-provided documents. While more complex than a monolithic approach, the modularity, adaptability, and potential for specialized expertise offered by this swarm intelligence architecture provide a promising direction for building more capable and robust conversational AI systems.\n\n---\n\n### Language & Framework\n\n- [x] Python\n- [ ] C#\n- [ ] Java\n- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript\n- [ ] Microsoft Copilot Studio\n- [ ] Microsoft 365 Agents SDK\n- [ ] Azure AI Agent Service\n\n### Project Repository URL\n\nhttps://github.com/Adithyan773/Decentralized-Multi-Agent-Swarm-Chat-System-DELVIN-AI-\n\n### Deployed Endpoint URL\n\n_No response_\n\n### Project Video\n\nhttps://youtu.be/uRckRl0AgGQ\n\n### Team Members\n\nAdithyan773,sathyasubrahamanaya\n\n### Registration Check\n\n- [x] Each of my team members has filled out the registration form", "author": "Adithyan773", "timestamp": "2025-04-28T15:43:39Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you for participating in Microsoft's AI Agents Hackathon 2025!

In general, you just copy the message you had in the NEWS file you created with blurb in the `Doc/whatsnew/3.14.rst` file. In this file, add something along the lines:\r\n\r\n```rst\r\nMODULE_NAME\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* WHAT_WAS_DONE\r\n  (Contributed by YOU in :gh:`ISSUE_NUMBER`.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your case, you can use `MODULE_NAME = http`. The entry would look like that:\r\n\r\n```rst\r\nhttp\r\n----\r\n\r\n* Directory lists and error pages generated by the :mod:`http.server`\r\n  ....\r\n\r\n* Added support for HTTP Range header to :class:`~http.server.HTTPServer`.\r\n  (Contributed by YOU in :gh:`86809`.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `http` module is already documented so you can just add an entry as above. Look for \"Directory lists and error pages [...]\" already existing item. Now, we will document the change in `Doc/library/http.server.rst` as well. To that end, change `.. class:: HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)` as follows:\r\n\r\n```rst\r\n\r\n.. class:: HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)\r\n\r\n   blablabla\r\n    \r\n   .. versionchanged:: next\r\n      Added support for HTTP Range header.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure whether we want to document `copyfile` or not.\r\n\r\n- For users subclassing `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.copyfile`, they would know the correct signature. But I'm not sure the method is meant to be subclassed even if it has a public name. It is not documented at all.\r\n- However, if we document it, it would seem weird not to document the other public-looking methods...\r\n\r\nSince it's your first contribution, I suggest the following:\r\n\r\n- Revert the NEWS wording that mentions `range` and simply say that you added HTTP Range header support (namely, write <code>\"Added support for HTTP Range header to :class:\\`~http.server.HTTPServer\\`.\"</code>)\r\n- Update `Doc/whatsnew/3.14.rst` as above.\r\n- Update `Doc/library/http.server.rst` as above.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be more precise and also document `copyfile`, we should probably do it in a follow-up PR. But AFAIK, a user shouldn't call `copyfile` *manually*, so they do not really need to know about the new parameter I think.\r\n", "author": "picnixz", "timestamp": "2024-12-15T10:23:40Z"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "@picnixz I'm finally back after working out some other annoying stuff, sorry for the delay.

Please make sure to attend the general Hack for LA onboarding to get the process started https://meetup.com/hackforla/events.\n\n### Overview\nAs a developer on the Website team this issue will be your companion and a place to track your progress with the path we have set out for you.\n\n### Special Notes\n1. This issue will stay open for as long as you are on the Website team.  Use it as a place to indicate that you have completed a level as well as get instructions on how to progress. \n2. Usually we don't want you to have more than one issue assigned to you at a time, this issue is the exception, because it is instructions on how to work on other issues.  Do not close this issue until you leave the team (please see to do items associated with leaving professionally).\n3. The action items listed below should mostly be worked on in a sequential order. However, you don't have to wait on one if you can proceed with the others. For instance, you don't have to wait for attending a weekly meeting before setting up your dev environment.  \n4. During the general Hack for LA onboarding, you will be directed to fill out a form that will add you to the Website team Google Drive and GitHub teams, and then you will add yourself to the roster.

Issues get more complicated from here, either they include more changes, or have several files to change or you have to research something that we are unsure how to do, or there is complicated logic that needs writing or rewriting. Each issue size that you take on will guide you to a more complicated level in sequence, and you can see from the labels and overviews what they are about.  \n\nIts important that you try to work on issues that fill in gaps in your knowledge (see the self tests for a reminder about what to look for).  \n- [INTAKE  Self Test](#Intake_Skills_List)\n- [ONGOING Skills List](#Ongoing_Skills_List)\n\nSo keep going, the fun stuff is about to start.\n\nHaving said that, we are also going to have you take on some issue making (surprise! There is no issue making fairy, only volunteers like you that created issues for the people that come after them).  Pay attention to how the issues you have already worked on are constructed and how they change as they go up the ladder. That way when we start you on the issue making portion of the team work, you will know what you are shooting for when its your time to make issues.\n\nAlso, we want you on the Merge team.

By implementing this as an MCP tool, Claude will be able to extract and format CSS from Figma elements on demand.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Add the Function to document-tools.ts\n\nFirst, we need to create the get_css_async function in the document-tools.ts file:\n\n```typescript\nexport const get_css_async = {\n  name: \"get_css_async\",\n  description: \"Gets CSS properties from selected Figma elements\",\n  parameters: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      // Optional node ID parameter - if not provided, uses current selection\n      nodeId: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        description: \"ID of the node to get CSS from (optional - uses selection if not provided)\"\n      },\n      // Optional format parameter - determines how CSS is returned\n      format: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        enum: [\"object\", \"string\", \"inline\"],\n        description: \"Format to return CSS in: 'object' (JSON), 'string' (CSS declarations), or 'inline' (inline style)\",\n        default: \"string\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \n  async handler({ nodeId, format = \"string\" }, context) {\n    try {\n      // Send command to Figma plugin\n      const response = await context.socket.sendCommand({\n        command: \"get_css_async\",\n        params: { nodeId, format }\n      });\n      \n      if (response.error) {\n        throw new Error(response.error);\n      }\n      \n      return response.result;\n    } catch (error) {\n      return {\n        error: `Failed to get CSS: ${error.message}`\n      };\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThis implementation defines a tool that accepts optional parameters for specifying a node ID and the desired output format.\n\n### Step 2: Register the Tool in tools/index.ts\n\nNext, we need to register the new tool in the tools/index.ts file:\n\n```typescript\n// In tools/index.ts\nimport { get_css_async } from './document-tools';\n\n// Add to the tools array\nexport const tools = [\n  // ... other tools\n  get_css_async,\n  // ... other tools\n];\n```\n\nThis ensures that the tool is properly registered and available for use in the MCP.\n\n### Step 3: Implement Plugin-Side Handler in code.js\n\nFinally, we need to implement the handler in the Figma plugin (code.js) to process the get_css_async command:\n\n```javascript\n// In the Figma plugin code.js\n\n// Handle the get_css_async command\nif (msg.command === \"get_css_async\") {\n  const { nodeId, format } = msg.params;\n  \n  // Get the target node\n  let targetNode;\n  if (nodeId) {\n    // Get node by ID if provided\n    targetNode = figma.getNodeById(nodeId);\n  } else {\n    // Otherwise use the first selected node\n    targetNode = figma.currentPage.selection[0];\n  }\n  \n  if (!targetNode) {\n    // Handle error if no node found\n    socket.send(JSON.stringify({\n      id: msg.id,\n      result: { error: \"No node found. Please select a node or provide a valid nodeId.\" }\n    }));\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  // Get CSS properties for the node\n  targetNode.getCSSAsync().then(cssProps => {\n    let result;\n    \n    // Format according to preference\n    if (format === \"object\") {\n      // Return as-is (JSON object)\n      result = cssProps;\n    } else if (format === \"inline\") {\n      // Format as inline style string\n      result = Object.entries(cssProps)\n        .map(([k, v]) => `${k}:${v}`)\n        .join(\";\");\n    } else {\n      // Default: format as CSS declaration block\n      result = Object.entries(cssProps)\n        .map(([k, v]) => `${k}: ${v};`)\n        .join(\"\\n\");\n    }\n    \n    // Send back the result\n    socket.send(JSON.stringify({\n      id: msg.id,\n      result: { css: result }\n    }));\n  }).catch(error => {\n    // Handle errors\n    socket.send(JSON.stringify({\n      id: msg.id,\n      result: { error: `Error getting CSS: ${error.message}` }\n    }));\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThis handler processes the command parameters, retrieves the appropriate node, calls the Figma API's getCSSAsync() method, formats the result according to the specified preference, and returns it to the MCP server.\n\n## Supported Output Formats\n\nThe implementation supports three different output formats:\n\n1. **object**: Returns the raw CSS properties as a JSON object\n2. **string**: Returns CSS properties formatted as a CSS declaration block (default)\n[3](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/node-properties/). **inline**: Returns CSS properties formatted as an inline style string\n\nThis flexibility allows the tool to be used in various contexts such as code generation, style comparison, or debugging[3].\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the get_css_async tool:\n\n```javascript\n// Example 1: Get CSS from the currently selected element as a CSS declaration block\nconst css = await callTool(\"get_css_async\");\nconsole.log(css);\n// Example output:\n// {\n//   \"css\": \"width: 100px;\n//   height: 100px;\n//   background-color: #FF0000;\n//   ...\"\n// }\n\n// Example 2: Get CSS from a specific node as a JSON object\nconst cssObject = await callTool(\"get_css_async\", {\n  nodeId: \"12:345\",\n  format: \"object\"\n});\nconsole.log(cssObject);\n// Example output:\n// {\n//   \"css\": {\n//     \"width\": \"100px\",\n//     \"height\": \"100px\",\n//     \"background-color\": \"#FF0000\",\n//     ...\n//   }\n// }\n\n// Example 3: Get CSS as an inline style string\nconst inlineStyle = await callTool(\"get_css_async\", {\n  format: \"inline\"\n});\nconsole.log(inlineStyle);\n// Example output:\n// {\n//   \"css\": \"width:100px;height:100px;background-color:#FF0000;...\"\n// }\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the versatility of the tool in different usage scenarios.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\n### README.md Update\n\nAdd the following entry to the \"Features\" section of the README.md:\n\n```markdown\n**CSS Extraction**: Extract and format CSS properties from Figma elements via `get_css_async`.\n```\n\n### Changelog Update\n\nAdd the following entry to the Changelog section:\n\n```markdown\n### 0.5.0 (2025-05-10)\n- Add CSS extraction capabilities via `get_css_async` with support for multiple output formats\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nImplementing getCSSAsync() as an MCP tool enhances the claude-talk-to-figma-mcp repository by providing a straightforward way to extract CSS properties from Figma elements. This addition aligns with the repository's goal of enabling powerful AI-assisted design capabilities and facilitates design-to-code workflows. By supporting multiple output formats, the implementation offers flexibility to accommodate various use cases.\n\nThe modular architecture of the repository makes it straightforward to add this new capability while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase. The implementation follows the established patterns for error handling, parameter validation, and communication between the MCP server and the Figma plugin.\n\nCitations:\n[1]

The process involves both built-in functionality and custom plugin implementations, with **getCSSAsync** serving as the foundational method for CSS extraction.\n\n## Core CSS Extraction Mechanism\n\n### getCSSAsync Method\n\nThe **getCSSAsync** method is the primary mechanism for retrieving CSS properties from Figma nodes:\n\n```javascript\nconst cssProperties = await node.getCSSAsync();\n```\n\nThis asynchronous function returns a JSON object containing computed CSS properties for the specified node[1][7][13]. The method works across various node types including:\n- FrameNode\n- TextNode\n- ComponentNode\n- VectorNode\n- Shape nodes (Rectangle, Ellipse, etc.)\n\nThe returned CSS properties mirror those shown in Figma's Inspect panel, including layout properties, typography settings, and visual styles[1][13]. For text nodes, it handles complex text styling including:\n- Font stacks with fallbacks\n- Letter spacing (tracking)\n- Line height calculations\n- Text decoration properties[13]\n\n## Implementation in Code Generation Plugins\n\n### Native Integration\n\nFigma's Dev Mode uses **getCSSAsync** internally to power its built-in code snippets. When developers select an element in Dev Mode:\n\n1. The **getCSSAsync** method is called on the selected node\n2. Returned CSS properties are combined with layout context\n3. Code is formatted according to the selected output language (CSS, Tailwind, etc.)[4][8]\n\n### Plugin Architecture\n\nThird-party plugins extend this functionality through the Plugin API:\n\n```javascript\nfigma.codegen.on(\"generate\", async ({ node }) => {\n  const css = await node.getCSSAsync();\n  return [{\n    title: 'CSS Output',\n    code: Object.entries(css).map(([k,v]) => `${k}: ${v};`).join('\\n'),\n    language: 'CSS'\n  }];\n});\n```\n\nThis pattern allows plugins to:\n1. Access computed styles via **getCSSAsync**\n2. Transform properties for specific frameworks\n3. Add vendor prefixes or custom property names[2][14]\n\n## Advanced Use Cases\n\n### Responsive Design Handling\n\nPlugins like Anima and Overlay use **getCSSAsync** in combination with layout analysis to:\n- Generate media queries based on auto layout constraints\n- Convert pixel values to relative units (rem/em)\n- Create fluid typography scales[4][14]\n\nExample rem conversion:\n```javascript\nconst baseFontSize = 16;\nconst css = await node.getCSSAsync();\nconst fontSizeRem = `${parseFloat(css['font-size']) / baseFontSize}rem`;\n```\n\n### Style Variant Generation\n\nFor design systems, plugins combine **getCSSAsync** with component analysis to:\n- Extract variant properties from component sets\n- Map Figma properties to CSS custom properties\n- Generate CSS-in-JS code with variant classes[4][7]\n\n```javascript\nconst component = node as ComponentNode;\nconst variants = component.children.filter(c => c.type === 'COMPONENT');\nconst variantStyles = await Promise.all(\n  variants.map(async v => ({\n    name: v.name,\n    css: await v.getCSSAsync()\n  }))\n);\n```\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nWhile **getCSSAsync** is optimized for performance, developers should note:\n- Batch processing multiple nodes simultaneously\n- Caching results for complex component hierarchies\n- Handling mixed values (`figma.mixed`) in text styles[1][13]\n\nA typical optimization pattern:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getBatchCSS(nodes: SceneNode[]) {\n  return Promise.all(\n    nodes.map(node => node.getCSSAsync())\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Current Limitations and Workarounds\n\nRecent updates (as of May 2025) have addressed several historical issues:\n- Fixed incorrect parsing of bound values[9]\n- Improved handling of nested component overrides\n- Added support for CSS grid properties[1][7]\n\nRemaining challenges include:\n- Limited access to computed CSS custom properties\n- No direct access to browser-prefixed properties\n- Variant handling in complex component hierarchies[9][14]\n\n## Comparison of CSS Extraction Methods\n\n| Method                | Source          | Output Format       | Framework Support |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| getCSSAsync           | Plugin API      | JSON object         | All               |\n| Built-in code snippets| Dev Mode        | Formatted CSS       | Limited           |\n| Figma to JSON         | Community Plugin| Structured JSON     | Custom            |\n| REST API              | Files endpoint  | Partial style data  | Web               |\n\n## Future Developments\n\nThe Figma team has indicated upcoming improvements to CSS extraction:\n- Better support for CSS grid and subgrid\n- Access to computed CSS custom properties\n- Direct export of CSS cascade layers[4][8]\n- Improved pseudo-class handling for interactive states\n\nThese enhancements will build upon the existing **getCSSAsync** infrastructure while introducing new endpoints for advanced CSS capabilities[1][4].\n\n## Practical Implementation Example\n\nA complete CSS extraction workflow might look like:\n\n```javascript\n// Get selected nodes\nconst selection = figma.currentPage.selection;\n\n// Extract CSS properties\nconst cssData = await Promise.all(\n  selection.map(async node => ({\n    id: node.id,\n    name: node.name,\n    styles: await node.getCSSAsync()\n  }))\n);\n\n// Transform to CSS rules\nconst cssOutput = cssData.map(item => \n  `.${item.name.replace(/ /g, '-')} {\\n` +\n  Object.entries(item.styles)\n    .map(([prop, val]) => `  ${prop}: ${val};`)\n    .join('\\n') +\n  '\\n}'\n).join('\\n\\n');\n\n// Return generated code\nreturn [{\n  title: 'CSS Styles',\n  code: cssOutput,\n  language: 'CSS'\n}];\n```\n\nThis implementation demonstrates the core pattern used by most CSS generation plugins, leveraging **getCSSAsync** as the primary data source while adding formatting and structural transformations[2][14].\n\nThe method remains essential for programmatic CSS extraction from Figma designs, despite the existence of alternative visualization-based approaches in some community plugins[4][14].\n\nSources\n[1] Shared Node Properties | Plugin API -

This real-world, security-critical application provides strong validation for Ar.io's technology, attracting more sophisticated projects.\n\nBridging Decentralized Security with Decentralized Storage: NexsoQurity uniquely combines decentralized finance (via Polygon), its own Decentralized Security Network (DSN), and Ar.io's decentralized storage. This holistic approach strengthens the overall Web3 vision by demonstrating how different decentralized technologies can interoperate to create a more robust and secure internet, making Ar.io an integral part of a comprehensive security solution.\n\nIn essence, NexsoQurity doesn't just consume Ar.io's services; it actively elevates Ar.io's profile and utility by embedding its core security functions within Ar.io's immutable data layer, thereby driving significant, high-value usage and proving its real-world efficacy.\n\nBased on the project functionalities, here are the key differentiators that make NexsoQurity better than existing solutions:\n\nIntegrated Decentralized Security Network (DSN): Unlike most wallets that rely on centralized security measures or user responsibility, NexsoQurity incorporates a DSN. This network distributes security responsibilities, eliminating single points of failure and enhancing resilience against attacks.\n\nProactive AI-Powered Threat Detection: NexsoQurity uses AI to detect threats like anomalous transactions, phishing, and account takeovers before they cause harm. This proactive approach contrasts with the reactive security measures employed by many existing solutions.\n\nAdaptive Security Policies: NexsoQurity's security policies can be customized and adapt to user behavior. This allows for a more personalized and dynamic security posture compared to the static security settings offered by other wallets.\n\nHolistic Security Approach: NexsoQurity combines a non-custodial wallet with network-level security (DSN) and AI-driven intelligence. This comprehensive approach provides more robust protection than single-solution alternatives like basic non-custodial wallets or standalone security tools.\n\n## Team Experience & Background\n\n1.

Decentralized Architecture:\na.\tDistributed Security Network (DSN):\n\u2022\tInstead of relying on a single central authority, NexsoQurity utilizes a network of nodes, each running security algorithms and contributing to the overall security posture.\n\u2022\tThis DSN is built on Base\u2019s Blockchain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and resistance to single points of failure.\n\u2022\tNodes can be operated by individuals, institutions, or even dedicated hardware, incentivized through a token reward system.\n\nb.\tDecentralized Key Management (DKM):\n\u2022\tPrivate keys are fragmented and distributed across the DSN, using techniques like Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing (SSS) or Multi-Party Computation (MPC).\n\u2022\tThis eliminates the risk of a single point of compromise, as no single entity holds the complete key.\n\u2022\tRecovery requires consensus from a predefined number of nodes, ensuring robust security.\n\n\n\nc.\tSmart Contract-Based Security Policies:\n\u2022\tUsers can define custom security policies using smart contracts, specifying rules for transaction approvals, spending limits, and whitelisted addresses.\n\u2022\tThese policies are enforced by the DSN, providing granular control and automation.\n\n2. AI-Powered Threat Detection and Prevention:\na.\tAnomaly Detection:\n\u2022\tAI algorithms analyze transaction patterns, wallet activity, and network data to identify anomalies that may indicate malicious activity.\n\u2022\tThis includes detecting unusual spending habits, suspicious transaction destinations, and potential phishing attempts.\n\nb.\tBehavioural Biometrics: NexsoQurity can learn a user\u2019s typical interaction patterns, such as typing speed, mouse movements, and device usage, to create a behavioural profile.\n\u2022\tDeviations from this profile trigger alerts, helping to detect unauthorized access or account takeover attempts.\n\nc.\tReal-Time Threat Intelligence:\n\u2022\tThe platform integrates with decentralized threat intelligence feeds, aggregating data from various sources to identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities.\n\u2022\tAI algorithms process this data to provide proactive warnings and security recommendations.\n\nd.\tAdaptive Security: The AI adapts the security protocols based on the current threat level, and the users\u2019 individual habits. For example, if a large transaction is detected, and the threat level is high, multiple forms of verification could be initiated.\n\n3. User-Centric Features:\na.\tIntuitive Interface: NexsoQurity provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies complex security concepts, making them accessible to both novice and experienced crypto users.\nb.\tMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) Integration: The platform supports various MFA methods, including biometric authentication, hardware security keys, and time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).\nc.\tTransaction Simulation and Risk Assessment: Users can simulate transactions to assess potential risks and identify potential vulnerabilities before committing funds. The AI will give a risk score based on the recieving address, transaction amount, and other factors.\nd.\tRecovery and Dispute Resolution:\n\u2022\tIn the event of lost keys or unauthorized transactions, NexsoQurity provides a decentralized recovery process based on consensus and smart contracts.\n\u2022\tA dispute resolution system is integrated into the platform to handle contested transactions, with the DSN acting as a decentralized arbitration mechanism.\ne.\tPrivacy Focused: The platform can use zero knowledge proofs to hide sensitive information, while still allowing the network to verify transactions.\n\n4.  NexsoQurity as a Standalone Non-Custodial Wallet + Security is the core concept. NexsoQurity intends to provide its own non-custodial wallet with integrated security features and at the same time allow Users create or import wallets directly within the NexsoQurity platform.\nThe platform would then manage the secure storage and handling of private keys, utilizing its decentralized key management and AI-powered security systems.\nThis approach offers a seamless and integrated experience, where security is built directly into the wallet.\nNexsoQurity is also planned to be designed to act as a security layer that can be integrated with or used in conjunction with other non-custodial wallets.\nThis would allow users to maintain their preferred wallets while benefiting from NexsoQurity's advanced security features.\nThis could be implemented in multiple ways which include:\n1. WalletConnect Integration: NexsoQurity could integrate with WalletConnect, allowing users to connect their existing wallets and authorize transactions through the NexsoQurity platform.\n2. Extension/Plugin: A browser extension or plugin could be developed to monitor and secure transactions from other non-custodial wallets.\n3. API Integration: NexsoQurity could provide an API that allows other wallet developers to integrate its security features directly into their wallets.\n\nPotential Benefits:\n\u2022\tEnhanced security through decentralization and AI.\n\u2022\tReduced risk of single points of failure.\n\u2022\tProactive threat detection and prevention.\n\u2022\tGreater user control and transparency.\n\u2022\tImproved privacy and data protection.\n\u2022\tA more secure and accessible crypto ecosystem.\nNexsoQurity represents a vision for a more secure and user-friendly crypto future, where AI and decentralization work together to protect users\u2019 digital assets.\n\n<img width=\"960\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33fcf2e6-7dae-49b4-8c08-0b8993ec1b2c\" />\n\n\n**NexsoQurity User interface**\nDesigning the user interface (UI) for NexsoQurity requires balancing advanced security features with user-friendliness.

The percentages below are examples and would be carefully considered before launch:\n1.\tTeam & Advisors (15%): 15,000,000 NEXQ\na.\tAllocated to the core development team, advisors, and early contributors.\nb.\tSubject to a vesting schedule (e.g., locked for a period and then released linearly over several months or years) to ensure long-term commitment.\n\n2.\tEcosystem Growth & Partnerships (20%): 20,000,000 NEXQ \na.\tReserved for strategic partnerships with other blockchain projects, wallets, exchanges, and security firms.\nb.\tUsed for marketing initiatives, community growth programs, and integrations.\n\n3.\tCommunity & Airdrop (10%): 10,000,000 NEXQ \na.\tAllocated for airdrops to early adopters, community rewards, and bounty programs to incentivize initial engagement.\n\n4.\tStaking Rewards (20%): 20,000,000 NEXQ \na.\tDesignated for rewarding users who stake their NEXQ tokens to enhance platform security and participate in governance. These rewards will be distributed over time.\n\n5.\tDecentralized Security Network (DSN) Node Rewards (25%): 25,000,000 NEXQ \na.\tEarmarked for incentivizing individuals and entities to operate nodes within the DSN. Rewards will be distributed based on node performance, uptime, and contribution to the network's security.\n\n6.\tFoundation Reserve (10%): 10,000,000 NEXQ \na.\tHeld by the NexsoQurity Foundation for future development, research, unforeseen expenses, and potential strategic initiatives. Subject to governance oversight in later stages.\n\nToken Utility\nThe NEXQ token is designed to have several key utilities within the NexsoQurity ecosystem:\n1.\tPayment for Services: Users may use NEXQ to pay for premium features within the NexsoQurity wallet (e.g., advanced AI analytics, priority support).\n2.\tDSN Node Staking Requirement: Operating a node within the DSN may require staking a certain amount of NEXQ as a commitment to the network's integrity.\n3.\tDSN Node Rewards: As mentioned above, NEXQ tokens will be the primary reward mechanism for DSN node operators.\n4.\tStaking Rewards for Users: Users who stake their NEXQ tokens may earn rewards, potentially a percentage yield based on the amount and duration of their stake.1 This incentivizes holding and participation.\n5.\tGovernance: NEXQ token holders will have the right to participate in the governance of the NexsoQurity platform. This may include voting on proposals for feature upgrades, changes to tokenomics, or allocation of foundation resources. The weight of their vote may be proportional to the amount of NEXQ they hold.\n6.\tDispute Resolution Fees: NEXQ tokens might be used to pay fees associated with initiating or participating in the decentralized dispute resolution process.\n7.\tPotential for Integrations: Future integrations with other DeFi platforms or services within the Base ecosystem could further expand the utility of NEXQ.\nToken Emission Schedule\nWhile the initial supply is fixed at genesis, future emission of NEXQ might occur through staking and node rewards. The emission schedule for these rewards would be carefully designed to balance incentivizing participation with avoiding excessive inflation.\n\u2022\tStaking Rewards Emission: The rate of NEXQ emitted as staking rewards will be determined by a predefined schedule or potentially adjusted through governance.\n\n\u2022\tDSN Node Rewards Emission: The rate of NEXQ distributed to node operators will depend on network activity, the number of active nodes, and a predefined reward mechanism.\n\n\nToken Burning Mechanism\nTo potentially enhance the long-term value of NEXQ, a token burning mechanism could be implemented. This could involve:\n\u2022\tBurning a percentage of transaction fees paid in NEXQ.\n\u2022\tBurning a portion of tokens used for specific platform features.\n\u2022\tPeriodic burns from the foundation reserve (subject to governance).\n\n Governance Model\nThe role of the NEXQ token in governance will evolve over time. Initially, the core team may have more control, but the goal is to progressively decentralize governance to NEXQ token holders. This will involve:\n\u2022\tProposal Submission: NEXQ holders can submit proposals for changes to the platform.\n\u2022\tVoting: NEXQ holders can vote on submitted proposals, with voting power proportional to their token holdings.\n\u2022\tImplementation: A defined process for implementing approved proposals.\nThis detailed token economics framework provides a foundation for the NEXQ token within the NexsoQurity platform. Remember that these parameters should be carefully considered and may evolve as the project develops and the community provides feedback.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f86b6536-75cf-454a-9f4d-33343fc38b2a)\n\n\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [ \u2705] I have read and understand the AR.IO Foundation Grant Framework\n- [ \u2705] I understand this is an application and funding is not guaranteed\n- [ \u2705] I am prepared to sign a grant agreement if my proposal is accepted\n- [ \u2705] I will provide regular updates and milestone reports as required\n- [ \u2705] I understand payment will be made in ARIO based on the exchange rate at time of payment\n- [ \u2705] I confirm that neither our organization nor any of our employees, contractors, or executive leadership is located in, or a resident of, an OFAC-sanctioned country\n", "author": "Nexsosphere-Technologies", "timestamp": "2025-05-24T20:44:32Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hye @Nexsosphere-Technologies - thanks for your proposal.

This PR will not solve the issue fully, but will at least improve the pod generation speed. From a hot loop to a cold loop. So over time we will still get to 12500 failed pods before they are garbage collected. The ReschedulePodsOnKubeletRejection should solve the cold loop into an immediate feedback between a kubelet/scheduler and move the pod to another node without failing the pods in the first place.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

ADHD Guardian is the empathetic AI companion I wish I'd had throughout my own journey.\"\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Project Overview\n\n**ADHD Guardian** is an AI-powered web application specifically designed as a supportive work companion for professionals and students with ADHD. It aims to mitigate executive function challenges by providing AI-driven task decomposition, prioritization assistance, and positive reinforcement\u2014all while integrating seamlessly with Microsoft productivity tools.\n\n### \ud83d\udcca The Challenge: The ADHD \"Wall of Awful\"\n\nFor the estimated 4-5% of adults worldwide living with ADHD (approximately 366 million people), initiating tasks\u2014especially complex or open-ended ones\u2014can feel like hitting an invisible barrier, often referred to as the \"Wall of Awful.\" This executive function challenge involves difficulties with:\n\n- Planning and organizing work\n- Sequencing steps in logical order\n- Prioritizing competing demands\n- Overcoming the mental inertia required to simply start\n\nStandard productivity tools often feel rigid or even add to the overwhelm, lacking the specific support needed to bridge the gap between intention and action. The result? Frustration, procrastination, missed deadlines, and untapped potential\u2014all contributing to the estimated $67 billion in lost workplace productivity annually attributed to ADHD.\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Solution\n\nADHD Guardian acts as a non-judgmental, supportive co-pilot specifically designed to help neurodivergent individuals navigate executive function hurdles. Instead of just listing tasks, it tackles the critical first step: **task initiation**.\n\nThe application leverages Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) through an AI persona named \"Em\" to:\n\n1. **Decompose Overwhelm**: Users input a task or objective they find daunting\n2. **Generate Actionable Steps**: Em breaks the task down into 3-5 small, concrete, achievable first steps\n3. **Provide Sincere Encouragement**: Crucially, Em offers brief, gentle understanding focused only on starting the very first step\u2014validating the difficulty without judgment\n\nThe goal is not to replace planning tools but to provide the scaffolding and dopamine boost needed to overcome initiation paralysis and build momentum.\n\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Technical Architecture\n\n### High-Level Architecture\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04de56a4-0150-45ba-b01b-153d5fa28ac3)\n\n### Authentication Flow\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e57eafc-0178-4790-9a3d-58c4ed5be1a3)\n\n### Component Diagram\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d005ac93-6edc-48b7-9247-c8f941d137c9)\n\n### Technology Stack\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a2bab79-6d40-45b5-b2b9-f81c7a530bbb)\n\n\n                \n## \u2728 Key Features (Current MVP)\n\n- **AI-Powered Task Decomposition**: Uses Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) to break down user-inputted tasks\n- **Contextual Encouragement**: Provides tailored, non-judgmental prompts focused on the first action step\n- **Microsoft Account Authentication**: Secure login via Azure AD using MSAL for Python\n- **Simple Web Interface**: Clean UI built with Flask, HTML, and Tailwind CSS\n- **(Demo) Task & Calendar Views**: Placeholder pages showing hardcoded tasks and basic calendar fetching via Microsoft Graph API (requires user consent)\n\n\n### AI Agent UI page screenshots\n\n#### Login Screen\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c0dc632-b2ad-461a-ab0d-a206a3765cdc)\n\n#### Main Interface - After logged-in Page\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21e2b64e-10ad-4272-8b43-6e883cff6fc8)\n\n#### Calendar View\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dae1f4a-e892-4fe9-ad91-8de0b8a6f341)\n\n#### To-Do Task List\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6398bb34-7154-40c2-8530-0a207a3d92ac)\n\n#### Task Breakdown Example\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b933419-cc8d-4880-913f-ac78d8e12390)\n\n\n## \ud83d\udcf1 Real-World Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: The Looming Work Project\n\n**The Struggle**: Alex, a marketing professional with ADHD, has been assigned to create a comprehensive campaign strategy. The deadline is two weeks away, but the open-ended nature of the task feels overwhelming. Every time Alex tries to start, they find themselves paralyzed, resorting to checking email or tackling smaller, less important tasks instead. As the deadline approaches, anxiety increases\u2014yet starting still feels impossible.\n\n**How ADHD Guardian Helps**: Alex opens ADHD Guardian and types: \"Create comprehensive marketing campaign strategy for new product launch.\" Em immediately breaks this down into specific, actionable first steps:\n\n1. Open a new document and title it \"Product X Campaign Strategy - Draft\"\n2. Write down the 3 main target audiences for this product\n3. List 5 key product features/benefits these audiences would care about\n\nEm then provides gentle encouragement: \"Just focus on opening that document and giving it a title right now. That's all. Getting started is often the hardest part for ADHD brains, and that's okay. This small step is actually huge\u2014and I'm here whenever you need the next step.\"\n\nThis concrete first step feels doable, reducing Alex's activation energy and helping them overcome the initial resistance.\n\n### Scenario 2: The Overwhelming Assignment\n\n**The Struggle**: Jamie, a graduate student with ADHD, needs to write a 20-page research paper. Despite being genuinely interested in the topic, they've procrastinated for weeks because they can't figure out how to start or organize their thoughts. Every time Jamie sits down to work, they feel overwhelmed by all the research they've collected and end up scrolling social media instead. Self-doubt creeps in (\"Maybe I'm not cut out for grad school\"), creating a negative feedback loop.\n\n**How ADHD Guardian Helps**: Trinity logs into ADHD Guardian using their Microsoft account and enters: \"Write 20-page research paper on climate change impacts on marine ecosystems.\" Em provides this breakdown:\n\n1. Create a new document titled \"Marine Ecosystems Paper - Working Draft\"\n2. Without any pressure for quality, write 3-5 sentences about why you personally find this topic interesting\n3. List the 3 main areas of marine ecosystems you want to cover\n\nEm adds: \"Hey Trinity, let's just focus on creating that document and writing those few sentences about your interest in the topic. Don't worry about perfection or even the full paper yet. Your ADHD brain might resist getting started because it's seeing the entire mountain instead of the first step. This tiny action will help build momentum. I'll be here when you're ready for what comes next.\"\n\nThis approach reduces the perceived scope, provides a concrete starting point, and acknowledges the executive function challenges without judgment.\n\n\n\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Installation & Setup\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Python 3.8+\n- An Azure account with access to Azure AD and Azure OpenAI\n- A registered application in Azure AD\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n1.

ADHD Guardian innovates by:\n\n- **Premise**: Addressing the specific, often overlooked neurodiversity challenge of ADHD task initiation in a work/academic context using an AI agent paradigm\n- **Technology Implementation**: Leveraging Azure OpenAI not just for generation, but for empathetic interaction through prompt engineering focused on a non-judgmental, supportive persona (\"Em\") tailored to ADHD user needs\n- **Beyond Task Management**: Moving past simple to-do lists to provide the specific scaffolding needed for breaking through initiation paralysis\n\n### Impact\n\nThe impact of ADHD Guardian extends far beyond simple productivity gains:\n\n- **Population Affected**: With 4-5% of adults worldwide living with ADHD (approximately 366 million people), and many more undiagnosed, the potential reach is significant\n- **Employment Challenges**: Adults with ADHD are 60% more likely to lose their jobs and earn 17% less than neurotypical peers\u2014largely due to executive function barriers that this tool directly addresses\n- **Educational Support**: The academic dropout rate for students with ADHD is 2-3 times higher than their peers, often due to difficulties with task initiation and follow-through\n- **Mental Health Benefits**: By reducing task-related anxiety and building a sense of capability, ADHD Guardian has the potential to improve self-esteem and reduce the negative self-talk common among ADHDers\n- **Accessibility Focus**: Many cannot access formal ADHD coaching or therapy due to cost or availability barriers\u2014this tool democratizes access to evidence-based executive function support techniques\n\nAs someone who has tried countless productivity apps only to abandon them when they added to my cognitive load rather than reducing it, I built ADHD Guardian to fill a gap in supportive technology that truly understands the ADHD brain.\n\n### Usability\n\n- **Real-world Scenarios**: Addresses common daily situations where ADHDers struggle to initiate tasks despite genuine desire to complete them\n- **Practical Interface**: Simple web UI designed to minimize distraction and cognitive load\n- **Familiar Authentication**: Microsoft Account login provides secure, frictionless access\n- **User-Centered Design**: Every aspect of the interaction is designed based on research into ADHD executive function needs and my own lived experience\n- **Responsible AI**: \n  - Non-judgmental, supportive tone built into prompt engineering\n  - Clear limitations acknowledged (not a replacement for therapy)\n  - Explicit consent for Microsoft data access\n  - Human-in-the-loop design principles for AI suggestion refinement\n\n### Solution Quality\n\n- **Functional Implementation**: Working Flask web application with clear frontend/backend architecture\n- **Security Focus**: Proper authentication flows and token handling\n- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, code comments, and architecture diagrams\n- **Technical Integration**: Demonstrates seamless integration of Flask, Azure AD authentication (MSAL), Azure OpenAI API, and Microsoft Graph API\n\n### Python Track Alignment\n\n- **Backend Development**: Core application logic built entirely in Python using Flask\n- **Service Integration**: Python libraries used for API interactions (requests, msal)\n- **Environment Management**: Python best practices for dependencies and configuration\n- **AI Implementation**: Azure OpenAI integration central to the core value proposition, not just an add-on feature\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Future Roadmap\n\n- **Full Microsoft Integration**: Complete integration with Microsoft Outlook Calendar and To-Do\n- **Task Completion & Sync**: Implement writing back to Microsoft To-Do when tasks are completed\n- **Persistent Views**: Add options for browser notifications or dedicated views to keep tasks visible\n- **Proactive Suggestions**: AI-driven proactive breakdown suggestions for complex upcoming tasks\n- **Prioritization Engine**: AI assistance in prioritizing combined tasks and events\n- **Mobile Application**: Develop companion mobile app for on-the-go support\n\n\n## \ud83d\ude4f Acknowledgments\n\n- Special thanks to people and organizations who support and advocate for neurodivergent\n- All neurodivergent individuals whose unique perspectives drive innovation\n\n---\n\nBuilt with \u2764\ufe0f by Emily F. -

Issues get more complicated from here, either they include more changes, or have several files to change or you have to research something that we are unsure how to do, or there is complicated logic that needs writing or rewriting. Each issue size that you take on will guide you to a more complicated level in sequence, and you can see from the labels and overviews what they are about.  \n\nIts important that you try to work on issues that fill in gaps in your knowledge (see the self tests for a reminder about what to look for).  \n- [INTAKE  Self Test](#Intake_Skills_List)\n- [ONGOING Skills List](#Ongoing_Skills_List)\n\nSo keep going, the fun stuff is about to start.\n\nHaving said that, we are also going to have you take on some issue making (surprise! There is no issue making fairy, only volunteers like you that created issues for the people that come after them).  Pay attention to how the issues you have already worked on are constructed and how they change as they go up the ladder. That way when we start you on the issue making portion of the team work, you will know what you are shooting for when its your time to make issues.\n\nAlso, we want you on the Merge team.  This will ensure you are a competent developer and an awesome collaborative contributor to any team you join in the future.\n\n- [x] Let us know that you have re-reviewed your issues, have read the above and are continuing on the team\n    ```\n    ### 10 - UNDERSTAND HOW TO PROGRESS THROUGH ISSUES IN THE PRIORITIZED BACKLOG AND ON ISSUE MAKING update\n    >Up to now we have just been getting you ready.

It enables developers to search and explore GitHub repositories, analyze complex codebases, generate production-ready code, and even create new applications from scratch\u2014all within a unified, voice-enabled interface.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>How It Works:</strong>  \n      Once a user accesses ORCA, they can perform a repository search using either text or voice input. The platform interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve repository information and file structures. A VS Code\u2013styled file explorer allows users to navigate project files; when a file is selected the AI engine\u2014powered by GitHub Copilot and enhanced by Microsoft\u2019s Azure AI services\u2014analyzes the code and provides detailed feedback. Voice interactions are enabled through Azure Speech Services, transforming spoken queries into text commands and converting responses back to natural speech. In addition, ORCA\u2019s App Creator feature guides users step by step to generate new applications, integrating multimedia assets (via third-party sources like Pexels) with Microsoft-driven best practices.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Key Use Cases:</strong>\n      <br>\n      \u2022 <em>Repository Exploration:</em> Quickly locate and inspect GitHub projects, view detailed file structures, analyze code quality, and understand project architecture with minimal manual effort.\n      <br>\n      \u2022 <em>Code Analysis &amp; Generation:</em> Identify bugs and performance issues within an existing codebase and receive context-aware suggestions for improvements. Generate new code that follows modern best practices without starting from scratch.\n      <br>\n      \u2022 <em>Voice-Controlled Development:</em> Use natural language commands to search projects, ask detailed questions about code, or even initiate code generation and debugging. This hands-free approach increases efficiency and accessibility.\n      <br>\n      \u2022 <em>App Creation &amp; Deployment:</em> From ideation to launch, ORCA supports the design of complete applications in various programming languages.
