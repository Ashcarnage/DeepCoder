As shown in the bug, this can result in the ReplicaSet controller generating 1800+ pods per minute. This can have a negative impact on etcd/apiserver and cluster stability.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n<!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #<issue number>`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n-->\r\nPartially solves https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72593\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nThere is a proposed [ReschedulePodsOnKubeletRejection feature](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-wJhiNy84w7tzFdo9HqwTu5DrVSuXFLGTUv8FBiRAAc/edit?tab=t.0), but there is not enough bandwidth to implement it. This PR will not solve the issue fully, but will at least improve the pod generation speed. From a hot loop to a cold loop. So over time we will still get to 12500 failed pods before they are garbage collected. The ReschedulePodsOnKubeletRejection should solve the cold loop into an immediate feedback between a kubelet/scheduler and move the pod to another node without failing the pods in the first place.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

I have to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target and return their indices. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the problem says that each input has exactly one solution, and I can't use the same element twice. That means there's only one pair that adds up to the target. But I still need to find that pair efficiently.\n\nThe first idea that comes to mind is using a brute force approach. I can loop through each element and for each element, loop through the rest of the array to see if any pair adds up to the target. Once I find such a pair, I return their indices. But wait, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which might not be efficient for large arrays. However, since the problem says there's exactly one solution, maybe it's acceptable, especially if the array isn't too big.\n\nLet me think about the examples given. For example, in the first example, nums = [2,7,11,15], target =9. The pair is 2 and 7, which are at indices 0 and 1. So the brute force approach would find this quickly.\n\nBut what about when the array is larger? For example, if the array has thousands of elements, the brute force method might be slow. So maybe I should think of a more efficient way.\n\nAnother idea is to use a hash map to store the numbers and their indices as I iterate through the array. For each number, I can calculate the complement (target - current number) and check if the complement exists in the hash map. If it does, then I have found the two numbers. This approach would have a time complexity of O(n), which is much better.\n\nWait, but how does the hash map handle the indices? Let me think. I can create a dictionary where the key is the number and the value is its index. As I iterate through each number in the array, I check if the complement (target - num) is already in the dictionary. If yes, then the current index and the index stored in the dictionary for the complement are the two indices I need to return.\n\nBut wait, what if the same number appears more than once? Like in example 3, where nums = [3,3], target=6. The indices would be 0 and 1. So the hash map approach should handle that because when I process the second 3, the complement is 3, which is already in the map with index 0. So it would correctly return [0,1].\n\nLet me outline the steps for the hash map approach:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store numbers and their indices.\n2. Iterate through each number in the array along with its index.\n3. For each number, calculate the complement (target - num).\n4. Check if the complement is in the dictionary.\n   a. If it is, return the indices of the current number and the complement's index.\n   b. If not, add the current number and its index to the dictionary.\n5. Continue until the pair is found.\n\nThis approach should work efficiently. Let me test this logic with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\nnums = [2,7,11,15], target=9\n- Initialize dict = {}\n- i=0, num=2. complement=7. dict is empty, so add 2:0.\n- i=1, num=7. complement=2. 2 is in dict, so return [0,1]. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\nnums = [3,2,4], target=6\n- i=0, num=3. complement=3. dict is empty, add 3:0.\n- i=1, num=2. complement=4. Not in dict, add 2:1.\n- i=2, num=4. complement=2. 2 is in dict at index 1. So return [1,2]. Correct.\n\nExample 3:\nnums = [3,3], target=6\n- i=0, num=3. complement=3. dict is empty, add 3:0.\n- i=1, num=3. complement=3. 3 is in dict at 0. So return [0,1]. Correct.\n\nLooks like this approach works for all examples.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases. What if the array has only two elements? Like [5,5], target=10. It should return [0,1]. The code should handle that.\n\nAnother case: what if the complement is found later in the array? For example, [1,2,3,4], target=5. The pair could be 1 and 4 (indices 0 and 3) or 2 and 3 (indices 1 and 2). But since the problem states there's exactly one solution, the code will find the correct pair.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there's exactly one solution, so I don't have to worry about multiple pairs. So the code will find the first possible pair as per the iteration.\n\nSo, the plan is to implement this hash map approach.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this in Python.\n\nI'll create a dictionary called num_dict. Then, loop through each index and number in nums. For each number, calculate complement = target - num. Check if complement is in num_dict. If yes, return [num_dict[complement], current index]. Else, add num: index to num_dict.\n\nWait, but wait: in the examples, the order in the output is the first occurrence of the complement and the current index. For example, in example 1, the first number is 2, and when 7 comes, the complement is 2, which is in the dict, so the indices are 0 and 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\ndef twoSum(nums, target):\n    num_dict = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_dict:\n            return [num_dict[complement], i]\n        num_dict[num] = i\n    return []\n\nWait, but what if the loop finishes without finding anything? According to the problem statement, each input has exactly one solution, so this case won't happen. So the return [] is just a placeholder.\n\nTesting this code with the examples:\n\nExample 1: returns [0,1]. Correct.\n\nExample 2: returns [1,2]. Correct.\n\nExample 3: returns [0,1]. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [5,5], target=10. Returns [0,1]. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [1,2,3,4], target=5. The first pair is 1 and 4 (indices 0 and 3), but let's see:\n\nLoop:\ni=0, num=1. complement=4. Not in dict. Add 1:0.\ni=1, num=2. complement=3. Not in dict. Add 2:1.\ni=2, num=3. complement=2. 2 is in dict at 1. So return [1,2]. But wait, the sum is 2+3=5, which is correct. So the code returns [1,2], which is correct.\n\nWait, but in this case, the pair is 2 and 3, which is correct. So the code works.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [0,4,3,1], target=4. The pairs are 0+4, 1+3. But according to the code:\n\ni=0, num=0. complement=4. Not in dict. Add 0:0.\ni=1, num=4. complement=0. 0 is in dict. So return [0,1]. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think this approach is correct and efficient. So I'll implement this.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two numbers in an array that add up to a given target and return their indices. The solution should efficiently handle the problem with a time complexity of O(n) using a hash map approach.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Hash Map Usage**: We use a hash map (dictionary) to store each number and its index as we iterate through the array. This allows us to quickly check if the complement (target - current number) has already been seen.\n2. **Iterate Through Array**: For each number in the array, we calculate its complement. If the complement exists in the hash map, we immediately return the indices of the current number and its complement. If not, we add the current number and its index to the hash map.\n3. **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that each element is processed exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), which is optimal for this problem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef twoSum(nums, target):\n    num_dict = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_dict:\n            return [num_dict[complement], i]\n        num_dict[num] = i\n    return []\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty dictionary `num_dict` to keep track of numbers and their indices.\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number in the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the number.\n3. **Complement Check**: For each number, we compute its complement (target - current number).

Let's see, the Fibonacci sequence starts with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. For any n greater than 1, F(n) is the sum of the two preceding numbers, F(n-1) and F(n-2).\n\nHmm, so for example, when n is 2, it's F(1) + F(0) which is 1 + 0 = 1. That makes sense. Similarly, for n=3, it's F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use an iterative method because recursion might be too slow for larger n due to repeated calculations. Iteration is more efficient here.\n\nSo, I'll start by handling the base cases first. If n is 0, return 0. If n is 1, return 1. For n greater than 1, I'll initialize two variables, a and b, representing F(0) and F(1). Then, I'll loop from 2 to n, updating a and b each time. In each iteration, a becomes b, and b becomes a + b. After the loop finishes, b will hold the value of F(n).\n\nWait, let me test this logic with an example. Let's take n=4. The steps would be:\n\n- a = 0, b = 1\n- i=2: a becomes 1, b becomes 0+1=1\n- i=3: a becomes 1, b becomes 1+1=2\n- i=4: a becomes 2, b becomes 1+2=3\nSo, the result is 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2. The loop runs once (i=2), a becomes 1, b becomes 1. So output is 1.\n\nWhat about n=0? We return 0, which is correct.\n\nI think this logic should work. Now, I'll write the Python code implementing this approach.\n\nThe code will read n as input, handle the base cases, and then iterate to compute F(n). I'll make sure to use variables appropriately and update them correctly in each step.\n\nLet me write the code step by step:\n\nFirst, read n from input. Wait, but in the problem statement, the function is given n as input. So maybe the code should be a function that takes n as an argument.\n\nSo, the function will be something like:\n\ndef fib(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b\n\nWait, let me test this function with n=2. The loop runs for i=2. a becomes 1, b becomes 0+1=1. So return 1. Correct.\n\nn=3: loop runs for i=2 and 3.\n\ni=2: a=1, b=1\ni=3: a=1, b=2. So return 2. Correct.\n\nn=4: loop runs for i=2,3,4.\n\ni=2: a=1, b=1\ni=3: a=1, b=2\ni=4: a=2, b=3. Return 3. Correct.\n\nThis seems solid. So the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think this should solve the problem efficiently without any issues.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the nth Fibonacci number efficiently. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves using an iterative method to compute the Fibonacci number. This method is chosen because it is more efficient than a recursive approach, which can be slow due to repeated calculations. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Handle Base Cases**: If `n` is 0, return 0. If `n` is 1, return 1.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For values of `n` greater than 1, initialize two variables `a` and `b` to represent F(0) and F(1), respectively. Then, iterate from 2 to `n`, updating these variables to hold the last two Fibonacci numbers at each step. After completing the loop, `b` will hold the value of F(n).\n\nThis approach ensures that we compute the Fibonacci number in linear time, O(n), with constant space complexity, O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef fib(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Base Cases**: The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1 and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number immediately.\n- **Iteration**: For `n` greater than 1, the function initializes `a` to 0 and `b` to 1. It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `a` and `b` in each iteration. `a` is updated to the value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`.

Can you help me understand the best approach?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Developing a backup and disaster recovery plan can be a complex task, but breaking it down into smaller steps can make it more manageable. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you develop a comprehensive plan:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Critical Systems and Data**\n\n* Identify the most critical systems and data that require backup and recovery.\n* Consider the impact on business operations, customer relationships, and financial losses if these systems or data are unavailable.\n* Make a list of critical systems and data, including:\n\t+ Applications\n\t+ Databases\n\t+ File servers\n\t+ Cloud storage\n\t+ Email\n\t+ Business-critical files and documents\n\n**Step 2: Determine Backup Frequency and Retention**\n\n* Determine the frequency of backups based on the criticality of the data and systems.\n* Consider the following factors:\n\t+ Data modification frequency\n\t+ Data volatility\n\t+ Business requirements\n* Set a realistic backup frequency, such as daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the data's criticality.\n* Determine the retention period for backups, taking into account:\n\t+ Compliance requirements\n\t+ Data aging\n\t+ Storage constraints\n\n**Step 3: Choose Backup Methods and Tools**\n\n* Choose a backup method that suits your needs, such as:\n\t+ File-level backup\n\t+ Image-based backup\n\t+ Cloud backup\n\t+ Hybrid approach\n* Select backup tools that can handle the chosen method, such as:\n\t+ Backup software (e.g., Veeam, Veritas, Backup Exec)\n\t+ Cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage)\n\t+ NAS devices\n\t+ External hard drives\n\n**Step 4: Implement Backup Schedules and Processes**\n\n* Create a backup schedule that aligns with the determined frequency and retention period.\n* Automate backups where possible to minimize manual errors.\n* Establish a process for:\n\t+ Backup initiation\n\t+ Monitoring backup progress\n\t+ Handling backup failures\n\t+ Verifying backup integrity\n\n**Step 5: Test and Validate Backups**\n\n* Regularly test backups to ensure they can be restored in case of a failure.\n* Validate backup data integrity by:\n\t+ Verifying file checksums\n\t+ Restoring backed-up data to a test environment\n\t+ Conducting regular backup integrity checks\n\n**Step 6: Develop a Disaster Recovery Plan**\n\n* Identify potential disaster scenarios, such as:\n\t+ Data center failure\n\t+ Network outage\n\t+ Power failure\n\t+ Natural disasters\n* Develop a plan to recover from each scenario, including:\n\t+ Prioritization of systems and data\n\t+ Recovery steps (e.g., failing over to a secondary site)\n\t+ Testing and validation of recovery procedures\n\n**Step 7: Create a Communication Plan**\n\n* Establish a communication plan for disaster recovery, including:\n\t+ Notification procedures (e.g., emergency contact list)\n\t+ Situation reports\n\t+ Status updates\n\t+ Communication protocols for different stakeholders\n\n**Step 8: Continuously Monitor and Review**\n\n* Continuously monitor backups and disaster recovery processes to identify areas for improvement.\n* Review and update the plan regularly to ensure it remains effective and relevant.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Involve relevant stakeholders, such as IT, compliance, and business leaders, in the planning process.\n* Consider hiring a third-party consultant or expert to assist with the planning and implementation.\n* Keep the plan documentation organized, accessible, and up-to-date.\n* Implement a change management process to ensure changes to the plan are properly approved and tested.\n\nBy following these steps, you can develop a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plan that ensures business continuity and minimizes downtime in the event of a disaster."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you show me a specific example?"}], "agentic_patterns": ["error_handling", "step_by_step_reasoning", "planning"], "domain": "multi_step_reasoning", "complexity": "medium", "scenario_description": "Develop a backup and disaster recovery plan", "available_tools": [{"name": "email_sender", "description": "Send emails and notifications", "parameters": ["recipients", "subject", "body", "attachments"]}, {"name": "file_manager", "description": "Read, write, and manipulate files", "parameters": ["file_path", "operation", "content"]}, {"name": "code_analyzer", "description": "Analyze code for bugs, performance issues, and best practices", "parameters": ["code", "language", "analysis_type"]}]}, "quality_score": 0.8500000000000001, "metadata": {"scenario_type": "multi_step_reasoning", "scenario_index": 6, "variation": 1, "provider": "groq", "model": "llama3-8b-8192"}}
