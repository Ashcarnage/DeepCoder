To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3\nOutput: [1,2,2,3,5,6]\nExplanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].\nThe result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.", "difficulty": "easy", "category": "array", "examples": [{"input": "nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3", "output": "[1,2,2,3,5,6]"}, {"input": "nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0", "output": "[1]"}], "constraints": "nums1.length == m + n, nums2.length == n, 0 <= m, n <= 200, 1 <= m + n <= 200"}, "trajectory": {"steps": [], "final_answer": null, "success": false, "total_tokens": 0, "execution_time": 8.192769527435303, "metadata": {"tools_used": [], "step_count": 0, "error": "RetryError[<Future at 0x7e8014248f90 state=finished raised GroqAPIError>]"}}, "generated_at": "2025-05-30T11:15:51.816512"}
