Let's see, the Fibonacci sequence starts with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. So for example, F(2) is 1 because 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nHmm, the problem is to write a function that takes an integer n and returns F(n). Let's think about the possible approaches. I remember that there are different methods to compute Fibonacci numbers: recursive, iterative, using matrix exponentiation, or even using Binet's formula. But for this problem, considering efficiency and simplicity, an iterative approach might be best, especially since n could be large, and recursion could lead to stack overflows or be inefficient due to repeated calculations.\n\nWait, but what about the constraints on n? The problem statement doesn't specify, but in coding problems, n can sometimes be very large, like up to 10^6 or more. So using an iterative method with O(n) time complexity should be acceptable unless n is extremely large, in which case we might need a more optimized approach like matrix exponentiation or using fast doubling, which has O(log n) time.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that an iterative approach is sufficient. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Handle the base cases first. If n is 0, return 0. If n is 1, return 1.\n2. For n >= 2, initialize two variables, a and b, representing F(0) and F(1), both set to 0 and 1 respectively.\n3. Loop from 2 to n, each time updating a and b. Let's say, in each iteration, compute the next Fibonacci number as a + b, then update a to be the old b, and b to be the new sum.\n4. After the loop completes, b will hold F(n).\n\nWait, let me test this logic with some examples.\n\nFor n=2:\n- a=0, b=1\n- i=2: next = 0+1=1; a becomes 1, b becomes 1.\n- So return b=1. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n- a=0, b=1\n- i=2: next=1, a=1, b=1\n- i=3: next=1+1=2, a=1, b=2\n- Return 2. Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n- i=2: a=1, b=1\n- i=3: a=1, b=2\n- i=4: a=2, b=3\n- Return 3. Correct.\n\nSo the logic seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, I can use variables like prev and curr. Let me think: Initialize prev = 0, curr = 1. For each step from 2 to n, compute next = prev + curr, then set prev = curr, curr = next. After n steps, curr is F(n).\n\nYes, that's the same approach as before.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure. The function will take an integer n as input. So in Python, the function signature would be def fib(n):.\n\nInside the function, first handle the base cases. If n is 0, return 0. If n is 1, return 1.\n\nElse, for n >=2, we'll loop from 2 to n, updating the variables each time.\n\nLet me write a draft code:\n\ndef fib(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\n            next_val = a + b\n            a = b\n            b = next_val\n        return b\n\nWait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: n=2. The loop runs for i=2. next_val = 0+1=1. a becomes 1, b becomes 1. Return 1. Correct.\n\nExample 2: n=3. Loop runs for i=2 and i=3.\n\ni=2: next=1, a=1, b=1.\n\ni=3: next=1+1=2, a=1, b=2. Return 2. Correct.\n\nExample 3: n=4. Loop runs for i=2,3,4.\n\ni=2: a=1, b=1.\n\ni=3: a=1, b=2.\n\ni=4: a=2, b=3. Return 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nBut wait, what about n=0? It returns 0. Correct.\n\nWhat about n=1? Returns 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about larger n, like n=5? F(5) is 5.\n\nTesting with n=5:\n\nLoop runs for i=2,3,4,5.\n\ni=2: a=1, b=1.\n\ni=3: a=1, b=2.\n\ni=4: a=2, b=3.\n\ni=5: a=3, b=5. Return 5. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about n=6? F(6) is 8.\n\nLet me see:\n\ni=2: a=1, b=1.\n\ni=3: a=1, b=2.\n\ni=4: a=2, b=3.\n\ni=5: a=3, b=5.\n\ni=6: a=5, b=8. Return 8. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother approach could be using recursion, but that's not efficient for large n because it recalculates the same values many times. So iterative is better.\n\nAlternatively, using matrix exponentiation or fast doubling could be more efficient for very large n, but for the scope of this problem, the iterative approach should suffice.\n\nI think this should solve the problem correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the nth Fibonacci number efficiently.
