## 🤖 Teacher Model Feasibility Analysis

### **Feasible Local Teacher Models**

| Model | Memory Req | Feasible | Advantages |
|-------|------------|----------|------------|
| **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B** | 14 GB | ❌ | Too large for current setup |
| **Qwen2.5-7B** | 14 GB | ❌ | Too large for current setup |
| **Smaller Models (3B-5B)** | 6-10 GB | ✅ | Would fit comfortably |

### **Current Recommendation**

**❌ Local Teacher Not Feasible** with current memory usage  
**✅ Continue with Groq API** for DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 70B

**Reasoning:**
- Current available memory: ~4 GB
- Minimum teacher model needs: 6-14 GB  
- Better to optimize for reliable cloud teacher than risk OOM

## 💡 Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions**

1. **Continue with Current Setup**:
   - Qwen 30B student (confirmed working)
   - Groq API teacher (handles rate limits)
   - Existing SAD training framework

2. **Optimize Memory Usage**:
   ```bash
   # Clear unnecessary processes to free ~5-10 GB
   pkill -f "compile_worker"  # Clear torch workers
   torch.cuda.empty_cache()   # Clear CUDA cache
   ```

3. **Alternative Teacher Options**:
   - **Qwen2.5-3B**: Would fit in 6GB (smaller but capable)
   - **TinyLlama-1.1B**: Emergency fallback option
   - **Continue Groq**: Most reliable for production

### **Future Optimizations**

1. **Multi-GPU Setup**: Scale to use multiple GPUs
2. **Model Quantization**: 4-bit/8-bit to reduce memory
3. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduce training memory
4. **Batch Size Optimization**: Find optimal batch size
